<p>Following the upcoming acquisition of Coutts by ProQuest,&nbsp;<a title="Leading Research Database, E-book, E-journal Packages, Subscription Management and Discovery Service Provider" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWJzY28uY29tLw==">EBSCO Information Services</a>&nbsp;(EBSCO) plans to continue its relationship with OASIS, enabling libraries to purchase its selection of more than 700,000 e-books through the OASIS platform. The company&rsquo;s approach is for EBSCO titles to continue to be offered through all applicable purchase models, and for customer contracts with EBSCO to remain unaffected by the anticipated change in ownership of OASIS.</p>
<p>EBSCO CEO Tim Collins says &ldquo;Our intention to continue our participation with OASIS is based on our commitment to ensuring library choice through partnerships. We intend to continue our relationship without disruption to ensure support of libraries no matter which services they choose to utilize. This is driven by our approach to supporting library decisions by enabling a flexible environment for each library to evaluate and select the best of breed for every component in their end-to-end services infrastructure. We expect that this open collaboration will lead to greater library services and overall value for end users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To provide even greater value to libraries, EBSCO APIs and partnerships allow for not only more choice with services such as OASIS, but the opportunity to create a direct flow from the book ordering process to user discovery and access &ndash; creating unparalleled end-to-end value with a concentration on user outcomes and library satisfaction.</p>
<p>Librarians can gather specific information about their accounts as well as suggestions for addressing their e-book needs through their EBSCO representatives.</p>
