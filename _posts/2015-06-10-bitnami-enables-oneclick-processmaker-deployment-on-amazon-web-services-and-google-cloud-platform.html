ProcessMaker has always been known for making workflow and business processes automation simple to build and run. Our partnership with Bitnami now makes deploying to the cloud just as simple and easy. Our solution works transparently for web and mobile, so now organizations can literally be up and running with a solution to build custom mobile apps in minutes as well.&rdquo;</p>
