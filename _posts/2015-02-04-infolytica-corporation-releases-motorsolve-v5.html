<p>Engineers and designers of electric machines have a revamped &amp; more intuitive modeling environment to use when performing motor simulations and analysis as of today with the release of <a href="http://www.infolytica.com/en/products/motorsolve/">MotorSolve</a> version 5. Major additions to the software also enhance the charts and field data available to users.</p>
<p>Here are just some of the highlights available:</p>
<p><strong>An Even More User Friendly Software</strong><br />MotorSolve is among the most easy to use design software of its kind. Version 5 raises the bar of user friendliness by introducing a number of changes &ndash; both requested by users and created by <a href="http://www.infolytica.com/">Infolytica</a> &ndash; to the interface and modeling engine to make it easier and faster.</p>
<p>Using MotorSolve is simple and foolproof: after a thorough review of each motor template, design parameters have been renamed (to follow the latest standard terminology) and simplified in terms of geometrical options. The variational geometry engine, which gives MotorSolve the flexibility and power to handle virtually any motor design within these templates, has also been improved by being more responsive and providing more feedback to the designer by doing a best fit of dimensions for invalid geometries.</p>
<p>The user interface in MotorSolve 5 is much more responsive: setting values for the parameters, display updates, and in general all user interface operations are much faster.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency Maps, Arrow Plots</strong><br />MotorSolve v5 also includes a new motor efficiency map which automatically plots the efficiency at different operating points. It can be based on a quick linear approximation or accurate nonlinear computation. Surface force density plot has also been added to the result information available.</p>
<p>Other analysis tools such as arrow plots to show data superimposed on the motor template &ndash; such as the flow and magnitude of the current in the coils, have been added.</p>
<p><strong>Scripting<br /></strong>The same scripting capability that is used in our MagNet software which makes customization, batching and optimization possible, is now implemented in MotorSolve. Using scripting, all MotorSolve commands can be accessed through APIs, callable from any programming language, e.g. Visual Basic, or any application, e.g. Microsoft Excel, that is ActiveX compliant. It is possible to run MotorSolve as an engine, by invoking the module from the outside, in a script.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong><br />MotorSolve v5 is now available for Microsoft Windows 7 or 8. For information about the full list of improvements, request a demo, quote or full feature evaluation, please contact an&nbsp;Infolytica Corporation representative nearest you.</p>
