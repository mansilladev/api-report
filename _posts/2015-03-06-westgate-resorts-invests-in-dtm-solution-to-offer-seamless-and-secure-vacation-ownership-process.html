<p><a href="http://www.eoriginal.com/">eOriginal, Inc.</a>, DocuSign, Inc. (DocuSign&reg;), and Informa Software today have joined forces to deliver a seamless end-to-end&nbsp;<a title="eOriginal Digital Transaction Management" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eoriginal.com/solutions.html">Digital Transaction Management (DTM)</a>&nbsp;solution for Westgate Resorts. The all-digital Westgate Resorts Timeshare System will allow Westgate Resorts to become 100 percent digitally integrated throughout their entire business processes&mdash;from sales presentations to customer contract execution while providing secure vaulted management of all documentation and signed contracts and loans.</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>&ldquo;The complexity yet ease of use of this newly-developed Timeshare System is truly innovative,&rdquo; said John Willman, treasurer and VP of mortgage services at Westgate Resorts. &ldquo;We have been pleased throughout the entire process with the collaboration of eOriginal, DocuSign and Informa Software to produce a system that will benefit us for years to come. We are confident that the implementation of Digital Transaction Management will not only accelerate and control our business processes, but also increase our profitability and financial backings for the future.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The DTM solution for Westgate Resorts was developed through the use of Oracle and an API user interface to allow for Westgate Resorts to seamlessly originate, electronically execute, and securely vault every document needed in the vacation ownership process. Benefits of the cohesive process include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Providing a seamless buyer experience in a secure environment with access to all documents.</li>
<li>Eliminating the cost, time and potential human error of hard-copy document management by eradicating the process of printing, scanning, faxing and mailing paper contracts.</li>
<li>Allowing for use of mobile and tablet devices by both buyer and seller, with notarization capabilities.</li>
<li>Managing risk through eOriginal&rsquo;s eAsset&reg; Management Services with a secure path to manage Electronic Original&reg; documents throughout their lifecycle, ensuring the ability to pledge, sell, and securitize eAssets.</li>
<li>Eliminating third party transaction fees and providing continuous integration for county official records.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a secure and controlled process, the powerful joint solution of DocuSign and eOriginal from Informa Software allows for peace-of-mind not only for the buyer and seller who are actively engaging in the process, but also funding sources, custodians, and county recorders. The fully-digital solution complies with state notary and management requirements, in addition to providing an in-depth profile of the document&rsquo;s history from inception.</p>
