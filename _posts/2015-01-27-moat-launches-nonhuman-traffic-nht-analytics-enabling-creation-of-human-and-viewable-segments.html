<p><a href="http://www.moat.com/">Moat, Inc.</a>), an independent SaaS analytics firm focused on making brand advertising more effective for marketers, agencies, and premium publishers, today announced the launch of Non-Human Traffic (NHT) Analytics, allowing publishers and advertisers to analyze web traffic and ad views with greater precision than ever before. Moat can now provide NHT data alongside viewability, AVOC, and attention metrics across all components of the Moat Analytics suite, including Display, Video, Mobile, Native, and Content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new product leverages Moat's core analytics expertise to deliver an innovative solution for brand advertisers and publishers to better understand and address the impact of non-human traffic &ndash; and most importantly, isolate viewable impressions that are more definitively delivered to humans &ndash; in other words "human and viewable" impressions. According to Moat CEO and Co-Founder&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Jonah Goodhart</span>, the key is offering complete transparency into the data.</p>
<p>"So much of the conversation around non-human traffic has been occupied with terminology meant to worry people and definitions meant to be opaque. Moat intends to offer a fresh approach. NHT Analytics equips Moat customers with the additional data and insights they need to measure their ads at a very granular level, so they can move beyond impressions and clicks and toward a new world of verifiable human attention."</p>
<p>Moat's NHT Analytics product provides specific metrics in context for non-human traffic signals such as Automated Browser, Incongruous Browser, Data Center Traffic, and Spider rates. It also provides a clear picture of other diagnostics via our Traffic Pattern Analytics - that may encourage deeper dives such as by Proxy Rate, Non-US Traffic, and Outdated Browsers, among others. With greater clarity, publishers and advertisers alike have a better perspective as to how to determine the true performance of advertising programs, and make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>With the addition of NHT metrics, Moat can now also offer clients detailed Human and Viewable rates in addition to traditional In-View rates, and can leverage the data to enable the building of highly targeted audience segments &ndash; zeroing in on more attentive users to drive increased success for marketers and publishers.</p>
<p>For current Moat Analytics customers, NHT Analytics can be instantly activated through the existing Moat integration. All Moat NHT data is also available through the <a href="http://www.moat.com/moat_analytics">Moat Analytics API</a>.</p>
