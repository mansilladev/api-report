<p><a href="http://www.evaluationkit.com">EvaluationKIT</a>, a leader in enterprise online course evaluation and survey software for higher education, has joined the highest Instructure partnership tier as an Alliance Partner, empowering the two companies to work more closely than ever in meeting the needs of Canvas clients. Canvas is a modern learning management system (LMS) that makes teaching and learning easier for instructors and students. Through this partnership, institutions can now benefit from a seamless integrated solution that aims to improve how they gather and implement student feedback directly within Canvas.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"We appreciate the opportunity to work with Instructure to help institutions learn about and implement our streamlined approach to student feedback," said Kevin Hoffman, president and CEO of EvaluationKIT. "We continue to see solid traction with Canvas customers and are grateful for the outstanding reviews we are getting from the Canvas user community. Being part of this elite alliance group gives us increased visibility as a trusted, strategic course evaluation partner."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">EvaluationKIT's integration with Canvas leverages a unique mix of Learning Tools Interoperability&trade; (LTI&trade;) and API functionality to ensure ease-of-use and data accuracy when it comes to managing the student feedback process. Students can conveniently access surveys and provide feedback within their learning environment, which contributes to increased response rates.  Additionally, colleges and universities can easily collect and analyze information, creating relevant reports that are accessible directly within Canvas.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"EvaluationKIT's integrated course evaluation technology plays a key role for our customer institutions, giving them more ways to leverage student feedback data to improve the student-institution communication loop," said Melissa Loble, VP of Partners and Programs at Instructure. "Our Alliance Partner program brings together the kinds of companies that share our commitment to innovation and to our Canvas clients. We are thrilled to be working with EvaluationKIT in this capacity."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Instructure's Alliance Partner program connects Canvas customers with breakthrough technological resources, giving users access to the solutions that enable them to deliver high quality, educational experiences. Instructure identifies partners that have the tools and services often requested by customers, as well as aligns with those companies that are good to work with both from a customer-facing and internal programmatic perspective.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Instructure and EvaluationKIT are hosting a joint webinar on September 15th where Canvas customers will gain insight into the ways they can streamline the online course evaluation and survey process. Details will be released to Canvas customers in the near term.</p>
