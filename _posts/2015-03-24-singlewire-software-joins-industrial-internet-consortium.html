<p><a href="http://www.singlewire.com">Singlewire Software</a>, developers of the<a href="https://www.singlewire.com/informacast.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;InformaCast</a>&nbsp;notification platform, today announced its membership in the<a href="http://www.industrialinternetconsortium.org/" target="_blank">&nbsp;Industrial Internet Consortium</a>, a not-for-profit international consortium that is setting the architectural framework and direction for the Industrial Internet. Founded in 2014, the mission of the Industrial Internet Consortium is to coordinate initiatives to connect and integrate objects with people, processes, and data using common architectures, interoperability, and open standards. The Consortium is comprised of major technology companies, industrial end-users, government bodies, and academic institutions.</p>
<p>"We are excited to be joining the Industrial Internet Consortium to participate in the effort to find common standards and integration with the Internet of Things," said Paul Shain, CEO of Singlewire Software. "Our customers have a need for sending notification to groups of people based on events triggered by remote sensors in their organization. Increasingly, they're also looking to automatically trigger other systems on their network in reaction to these events."</p>
<p>&rdquo;One of the many benefits of deploying an Industrial Internet solution is predictive analytics which can determine when a failure in the system is about to occur,&rdquo; said Dr. Richard Soley, Executive Director, Industrial Internet Consortium. &ldquo;Notification software, such as the one provided by Singlewire, brings these alerts to the operator&rsquo;s attention so that issues can be remedied before they become full-blown problems. We&rsquo;re excited that Singlewire will be bringing their expertise in notification software to the table as an Industrial Internet Consortium member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"We see that many devices capable of triggering a message are not very good at notification delivery," states Ken Bywaters, EVP of InformaCast Product Management at Singlewire Software. "InformaCast is a solution that bridges that gap. It's built with an open API that enables customization and is capable of sending notification to groups of people on-premises as well as those that are mobile and remote."</p>
<p>Singlewire InformaCast is a full-featured, network-based, emergency notification and paging system. It allows users to simultaneously send and audio and/or text message to a variety of endpoints, including computer desktops, mobile phones, overhead paging systems, Cisco IP phones, digital signage, social media sites, and more.</p>
<p>InformaCast notification is available as a cloud-based service as well as an on-premises virtual appliance. It is deployed by over 5,000 organizations in 50 countries worldwide and can be purchased from any registered Singlewire partner, through Cisco&rsquo;s Solutions Plus program, or directly from Singlewire Software.
