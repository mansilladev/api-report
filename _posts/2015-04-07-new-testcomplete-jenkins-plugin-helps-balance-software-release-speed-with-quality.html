<p><a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear Software</a>, the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, <a href="http://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/">has released a TestComplete plugin for Jenkins</a>, a popular open source continuous integration tool. The new TestComplete Jenkins plugin helps simplify and streamline continuous delivery process by making it extremely easy for anyone to automatically execute and report on TestComplete tests through Jenkins. Customers deploying the new TestComplete Jenkins plugin are able to balance speed of application delivery with quality.<br /><br />While implementing continuous delivery, organizations often simplify the release process by prioritizing product backlog and releasing requirements in small increments frequently. This helps minimize cycle time between teams and accelerate application delivery schedules. Testing, many times, however can act as a bottleneck to such faster application delivery processes.<br /><br />Manual testing results in great inefficiencies as it is time consuming and error-prone. Similar inefficiencies are encountered while implementing automated testing practices. Scaling functional, non-functional and API tests for different testing environments can prove challenging and complex. Additionally, manual handoffs between development and automated testing teams result in an increased wait time, delaying faster feedback on the build and causing rework to accumulate. Finally, if out-of-the-box integration with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins is not available, testers often end up spending a significant portion of their time triggering automated tests through a clunky command line interface.<br /><br />With this plugin, SmartBear allows developers and testers to execute desired desktop, Web or mobile automated tests directly from Jenkins. Once tests are executed, results are automatically updated to Jenkins, minimizing the handoffs between the development and testing team and providing rapid feedback for the development cycle. The faster feedback loop on the build also helps developers find defects at the source code level quickly, reducing cycle time for fixing defects and helping achieve increased focus on quality. TestComplete&rsquo;s built-in functionality along with the new plugin lets organizations easily scale a variety of automated functional and API tests across multiple UAT environments.<br /><br />&ldquo;In a continuous delivery model, having an ability to deliver quickly as well as ensuring quality debt doesn&rsquo;t build up due to faster release schedules are equally important,&rdquo; said Murat Polat, Sr. Test Automation Engineer at Unisys Corporation. &ldquo;The new TestComplete Jenkins plugin delivers flawlessly on both these benefits. Automation capabilities of TestComplete combined with the new plugin will make it much easier for many of my customers to implement continuous integration and test automation, while ensuring quality of their release does not slip.&rdquo;<br /><br />TestComplete is one of the world&rsquo;s most recognized automated testing tools. The winner of four Dr. Dobb&rsquo;s Jolt Awards since 2010, and most recently, a winner of a DeveloperWeek 2015 Award, TestComplete empowers any tester, both novice and advanced, to create, manage and run automated tests for any desktop, Web and mobile application.<br /><br />&ldquo;Delivering high quality products rapidly to the marketplace necessitates having immediate feedback on the deployed build,&rdquo; said Nikhil Kaul, Product Manager, Testing Products at SmartBear. &ldquo;The new TestComplete Jenkins plugin helps organizations completely automate build-test processes for functional as well as API tests. Faster application delivery thereby becomes a breeze as teams can now test the quality and reliability of every build without any kind of manual intervention.&rdquo;<br /><br />For the latest updates, follow @TestComplete on Twitter.
