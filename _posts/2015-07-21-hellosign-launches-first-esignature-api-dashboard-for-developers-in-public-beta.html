<p><a href="https://www.hellosign.com/">HelloSign</a>, the easiest way to electronically sign legally binding documents, announces today the first ever eSignature API dashboard, giving developers that use the HelloSign API increased visibility into the details of their API integration and user activity. The new API Dashboard allows developers to view critical information about API requests and responses, track the status of signature requests, and inspect callback events for easy troubleshooting and debugging. The added visibility makes it significantly easier for developers to get started with the HelloSign API by reducing time and effort to implement.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">With the API Dashboard, developers with an active HelloSign API integration can immediately view and debug their requests and callbacks, see signature requests and the status of any embedded integrations, as well as keep track of their overall usage. The API Dashboard also greatly reduces the need for developers to reach out to HelloSign API support to retrieve basic info about their users&rsquo; account activity. Located directly in the API Settings tab within the account view, the API Dashboard gives developers the ability to quickly troubleshoot on behalf of their users, providing them with a better end-user experience. Developers that are new to the HelloSign API can immediately use and test the API Dashboard for free.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We built the API Dashboard to give developers direct access to the debugging information they need to build apps quickly. This first-of-its-kind tool for an eSignature API means developers can provide the best user experience for their customers," said Neal O&rsquo;Mara, CTO and Co-founder of HelloSign. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking forward to building even more valuable functionality into the API Dashboard in the coming months, all aimed at simplifying the development process and reducing time to market for developers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The beta version of the API Dashboard allows developers to view comprehensive information regarding API calls, event callbacks, and app configurations. Developers can easily toggle back and forth between live and test mode, making it simple to isolate production and development troubleshooting. The Dashboard also features a search bar that allows developers to easily find any attribute of a request or callback. This search function allows developers to use field specifiers and logical operators to build more complex search queries.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">HelloSign helps companies grow revenue faster by automating document workflows with an eSignature API, making it simple to embed secure and legally binding eSignatures directly into any website. The three key features of the HelloSign API are the ability to collect signatures, request signatures, and format documents for signing directly on any site. The API is always free during development with the option to self-sign up when purchasing a paid plan. Integrations go smoothly with help from tools like the API Dashboard and a Hipchat support room staffed by HelloSign engineers. Developers can send a first API call in minutes and app certification is free.</p>
