<p><a href="http://www.thesnaffu.com/">Snaffu</a>, an in-app bug submission tool launched by&nbsp;<a title="Clearbridge Mobile" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2NsZWFyYnJpZGdlbW9iaWxlLmNvbQ==">Clearbridge Mobile</a>, recently released a set of APIs that allow integration with test automation frameworks like Selendroid and Appium. The introduction of these APIs will extend automation testing capabilities for development and QA teams.</p>
<p>With so many mobile devices and environments to test on, many development teams have opted to run automated testing scripts to save time. However, these tools still involve significant manual effort. The Snaffu APIs eliminate this need. If a test case fails during automated testing, Snaffu is automatically triggered capturing relevant information like screen shots, device details/logs, network states and more. Snaffu then pushes the issue to tracking tools like Jira, Pivotal Tracker, and Asana. Users no longer have to manually confirm and submit any issues found through automation testing scripts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve done is make automated testing a truly automated process,&rdquo; said Deepak Chopra, CEO of Clearbridge Mobile. &ldquo;These APIs will let teams save time on investigating and logging issues because everything is done automatically via Snaffu.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Teams can now run their automation scripts and have them not only identify bugs, but also log them,&rdquo; added Clearbridge CTO Sanjay Malhotra. &ldquo;Users don&rsquo;t even have to hit a button to submit issues.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Snaffu team is currently working on extending the APIs to other mobile test automation frameworks like Calaba.sh.</p>
