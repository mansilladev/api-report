<p>We've acquired&nbsp;<a href="http://gelato.io">Gelato.io</a>&nbsp;makers of the popular API Documentation and Developer Portal tool, with an aim to expand and provide the service to everyone: from individual developers looking to document their API projects to Fortune 500 corporations requiring a secure and highly customizable on-premises solution.</p>
<p>When we met&nbsp;Nik&nbsp;(and Adam) a couple of months ago, it was clear to both of us that we could do much more for the API economy together, and so we decided to partner almost immediately.</p>
<p>The first thing you will notice is an acceleration of feature development. We&rsquo;ve already added more engineers to the team, moved Gelato onto our infrastructure, revamped the design, lowered pricing and we&rsquo;re working to make it simpler and more scalable. Phew!</p>
<p>One reason we decided to work with Gelato was their early integration with&nbsp;Kong, our open-source API gateway. With over 200,000 Kong Docker and 5,000 Kong instances running, one of the biggest community requests has been integration with a developer portal. This will let Kong users handle key management, developer on-boarding, and document imports. We think Gelato is the best tool for your team with native Swagger/API-blueprint support, auto-generated code samples, an API explorer, beautifully designed docs and seamless on-boarding features.</p>
<p>In addition a&nbsp;Galileo&nbsp;integration for API analytics is coming soon, so you can see and monitor the usage of your developers.</p>
<p>We have a solid roadmap for the months ahead and we&rsquo;ll go as fast we can to provide easy and beautifully designed Developer Portals for everyone.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />Mashapers</p>
