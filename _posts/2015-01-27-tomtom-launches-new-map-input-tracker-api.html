The API enables end-users to share map feedback quickly via their smartphone, tablet, laptop or in-dash navigation unit to contribute to high-quality maps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the launch of our new Map Input Tracker API, we give people the chance to share map feedback, through any connected device, wherever they are,&rdquo; says Charles Cautley, Managing Director of TomTom Maps. &ldquo;This API enables TomTom to shorten the time between detecting changes in the real world and updating a customer&rsquo;s map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TomTom is a global leader in smart mapmaking, and one of the first to use crowd sourcing to detect map changes. The launch of this Map Input Tracker API, combined with the recent launch of MultiNet-R, means TomTom can now deliver high quality, real-time map updates to customers faster than any other mapmaker on the market.</p>
