<p><a href="http://www.logicbroker.com">Logicbroker Inc.</a>, a leading provider of the cloud-based EDI and drop ship automation solution, logicbroker&reg;, today announced it has received the 2015 EDI Solution of the Year Award from the New England Electronic Commerce Users' Group (NEECOM).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Logicbroker was presented the honor at the 25th annual New England Electronic Commerce Users' Group Conference, which was held October 15 in Westborough, Mass. The award is presented annually to an organization that provides innovation and disruptive technology for its clients. NEECOM selected Logicbroker and its drop ship automation solution project with Candy.com, a large online candy store that receives the majority of its sales from big box retailers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Logicbroker partnered with Candy.com to help alleviate bottlenecks in the drop ship order fulfillment lifecycle. Candy.com is growing rapidly and needed a solution to scale EDI operations quickly by providing a high level of procurement automation. Logicbroker implemented an end-to-end solution with Candy.com&rsquo;s ERP system&mdash;NetSuite&mdash; to eliminate expensive manual touch points and costly data entry errors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This has been an exciting year of growth and activity for Logicbroker,&rdquo; said Peyman Zamani, CEO at Logicbroker. &ldquo;This honor is the result of a terrific team effort, which was made possible with help from Candy.com, NetSuite, and my talented Logicbroker colleagues.&rdquo;</p>
