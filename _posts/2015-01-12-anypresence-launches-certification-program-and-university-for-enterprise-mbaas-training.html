<p>To support the rapidly expanding <a href="http://www.anypresence.com/">AnyPresence</a> partner ecosystem that is implementing solutions on its enterprise mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) platform, AnyPresence has launched AnyPresence University, which includes hands-on workshops, training classes, and a multi-level certification program. The content is currently targeted towards AnyPresence strategic partners who are selling or implementing the AnyPresence platform, and will be available to customer audiences in the near future.</p>
<p><em>"AnyPresence University is a big leap towards the enhancement of our partner ecosystem. This training program complements our platform's unique flexibility, and provides partners with both strategic and tactical expertise in enterprise mobile app development,"</em>&nbsp;said<span class="xn-person">Susan Miller</span>, Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer at AnyPresence.</p>
<p>AnyPresence University provides content at both a technical and business level for sales, business analysts, architects, consultants, and developers. Depending on the audience, these courses are offered in either online live webinars or in-person classroom settings. Attendees who complete the coursework will be eligible to take an exam and become AnyPresence Expert Certified Consultants.</p>
<p><em>"We are thrilled that over a hundred architects and developers at major enterprise systems integrators and R&amp;D services firms, such as GlobalLogic, a product development services leader, were the first to attend AnyPresence University. Dozens of these mobile developers have already completed the exam to become AnyPresence Expert Certified Consultants, with more in the queue,"</em>&nbsp;added Mrs. Miller.&nbsp;<em>"We are also working on additional courses and certification levels to further extend AnyPresence University content for both partners and customers."</em></p>
