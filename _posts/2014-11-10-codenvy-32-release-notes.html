<p>Another great Codenvy release for your enjoyment! We will be releasing frequently. Since releasing the new Codenvy we have made 200 additional improvements focusing primarily on performance.</p>
<p>Codenvy 2 continues to be operated alongside the new Codenvy. Codenvy 2 will be shut down later this year. You may now automatically migrate projects from Codenvy 2 to the new Codenvy.</p>
<p><strong>Migrate Seamlessly: C2 Project Migration</strong></p>
<p>You may now optionally migrate your existing C2 projects to the new Codenvy. Your existing C2 projects are now displayed in the user dashboard. C2 projects appear with a warning message similar to:</p>

<p>To configure this project to work with the new Codenvy, open the project and follow the guided configuration steps. For more information on how to configure the right builders and runners for your project,&nbsp;<a href="http://mkto-ab050050.com/f005b0P0ZG000Y2AA9Y5004" target="_blank">you can see steps in our docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameterized Configuration: Find/Replace in Project Construction Recipes</strong></p>
<p>Codenvy Factory enables instant, shared development without an account. You can provision new projects from any computer using recipes. We have added a new action to perform a find / replace against a set of variables that lives within the source code. The find / replace occurs after the project has its source code cloned from an external source. This is ideal for inserting developer keys into the project after it is loaded. Here are the docs on how to use this&nbsp;<a href="http://mkto-ab050050.com/VZY6000b500Y200AP4A0H90" target="_blank">feature</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Widgets: Privacy, Permissions and ToolTips</strong></p>
<p>The user experience is enhanced with information widgets that provide instant access to privacy and your current permissions.</p>
