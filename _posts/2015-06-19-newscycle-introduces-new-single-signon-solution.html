<p><a href="http://www.newscycle.com">Newscycle Solutions</a>, the leading provider of software and services for the global news media industry, is pleased to announce a new Single Sign-On (SSO) application for the Newscycle Circulation product line.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with Syncronex, Newscycle&rsquo;s SSO solution eliminates the need for media company customers to have &ndash; and remember &ndash; multiple logins and passwords. Customer satisfaction improves as a result of the streamlined SSO user interface experience. In addition, SSO is proven to increase a site&rsquo;s compliance and security capabilities.</p>
<p>SSO also offers cost-saving benefits. Analysts like Gartner and Forrester report that password reset requests represent more than half of all calls to company help desks, and SSO helps to reduce the time, expense and frustration involved in managing such requests.</p>
<p>With Newscycle&rsquo;s SSO solution, Digital Paymeter is used as the Identity Provider (IDP), supporting single sign-on management and authentication for the Newscycle Circulation iServices Subscriber application.</p>
<p>Using Digital Paymeter as the IDP, Newscycle SSO also supports social media integration. Subscribers can login to media company sites with their existing Facebook credentials. If access to other social logins is needed, Newscycle&rsquo;s SSO can also integrate with third-party Identity Providers such as Gigya and Janrain, as well as most major industry content management systems.</p>
<p>SSO is available in the Newscycle Circulation 2014.1.5 release and higher. Interested customers must license the Newscycle SSO application programming interface (API.)
