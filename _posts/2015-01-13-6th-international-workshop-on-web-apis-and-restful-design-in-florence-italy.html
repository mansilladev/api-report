<p>6th International Workshop on Web APIs and RESTful Design (WS-REST2015)&nbsp;collocated with the 24th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2015)</p>
<p><strong><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">May 18, 2015</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Florence, Italy</strong><br /><br /><span>Who? Web researchers and engineers working on API servers and clients</span><br /><span>What? a full-day workshop on current and future challenges for Web APIs and their interaction</span><br /><span>Why? Web APIs are more important than ever, yet many unsolved problems demand our attention</span><br /><span>When? full-day workshop on&nbsp;</span><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">May 18, 2015</span></span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; paper submissions before&nbsp;</span><span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">January 24, 2015</span></span><br /><span>Where? at the WWW2015 conference in Florence, Italy</span><br /><br /><span>Thousands of APIs exist and their number is growing tremendously, while use cases become increasingly complex. In contrast to the human-oriented part of the Web, Web APIs are designed to be used by machines. This makes issues surrounding their design and integration significantly different from those of the traditional Web. However, this also enables the provisioning of new added-value automated solutions on the Web.</span><br /><br /><span>This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners by providing an open discussion forum around the design and use of the programmable Web. It is the principal venue for discussing latests findings and research and development results around the issues, practices, and best principles surrounding Web API design and use.</span><br /><br /><strong>Pressing Topics</strong><br /><span>We especially welcome research and engineering work in the following areas:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; development of intelligent and generic Web API clients</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; dynamic combination of and interactions between Web APIs</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; novel hypermedia-driven solutions</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; tackling the tremendous growth and heterogeneity of APIs</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; analysis and understanding of the social and economic factors surrounding the development, use, and adoption of Web APIs and mashups</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; novel solutions for the automated discovery and profiling of Web APIs</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; novel technologies for facilitating the development of mashups and services for the Web of Things</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; lessons learned from the deployment, maintenance and evolution of Web APIs and mashups</span><br /><br /><strong>All Topics</strong><br /><span>In addition to the topics above, this workshop is also open to:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; applications of the REST architectural style to novel domains</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; design patterns and anti-patterns for Web APIs</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; automated Web API composition</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; inverted REST (REST for push events)</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; integration of pub/sub with REST</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; REST-compliant transaction models</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; frameworks for Web API implementation and consumption</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; modeling Web APIs</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; resource design and granularity</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; evolution, versioning, and extension of Web APIs</span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; REST-protocols beyond HTTP</span><br /><br /><strong>Details and Deadlines</strong><br /><span>We welcome full papers (6 pages) and vision/demo/poster/breaking research papers (3 pages).
