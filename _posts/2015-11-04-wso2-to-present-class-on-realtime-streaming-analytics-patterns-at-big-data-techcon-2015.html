<p>Today&rsquo;s enterprises face a plethora of new data sources even as data rates continue to rise exponentially. In her class at Big Data TechCon 2015, <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> Technical Lead Seshika Fernando will discuss how organizations can process all this data in real time by implementing different streaming analytics patterns. The event is being held November 2-4, 2015 at the Chicago Mart Plaza in Chicago.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The intermediate-level class, &ldquo;Patterns for Real-Time Streaming Analytics&rdquo;, will be held 4:00 &ndash; 5:15 p.m. on Tuesday, November 3, 2015 as part of the Analysis track.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In her discussion of streaming analytics patterns, Seshika will focus on &ldquo;counting&rdquo; use cases, which represent the tip of the iceberg of existing and potential streaming analytics uses. She will explain the time dimension that is always present in data that arrives as part of a data stream. Then Seshika will examine how this time dimension makes it possible to implement and perform very powerful operations, such as time windows and temporal event patterns. Additionally, she will review how these real-time streaming analytics patterns can be used to store data and react accurately within milliseconds.</p>
