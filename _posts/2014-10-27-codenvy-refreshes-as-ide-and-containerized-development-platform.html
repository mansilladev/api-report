<p><a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy just re-launched</a> as a new platform that provisions, shares, and scales developer environments, providing devs with a microservices-powered way to deliver workspaces that are responsive and fast-loading.</p>
<p>Each microservice automates an atomic part of a developer&rsquo;s workflow &ndash; from code analysis to SQL queries to compilation to runners. Projects are constructed with an automation engine that configures code, plugins, dependencies, builders, and runners. Developers install nothing and develop through our browser client or their favorite IDE, whether they are online or offline.</p>
<p>Codenvy environments can be shared through email or IM. Privacy and access controls are provided to every developer, while workspace administrators define group and resource policies with the Organization addon.</p>
<p>Tasks, such as dependency analysis and unit tests, are executed in parallel transforming workspaces into supercomputers. Runners and custom tasks are given isolated Docker containers injected with source code and artifacts.</p>
<p>Codenvy is offered as a SaaS, on-premises, or white label offering. Free accounts come with unlimited projects. Plans start at $1 / month and scale to 2TB of RAM, with a <a href="http://site-wp.codenvy-stg.com/products/developer-environment-cloud-saas/">full price listing available on codenvy.com</a>.</p>
