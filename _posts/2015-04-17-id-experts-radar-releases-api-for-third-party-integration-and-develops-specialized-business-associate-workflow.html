<p>Security incidents have become an everyday occurrence in all industries that use and hold sensitive customer and patient information. RADAR<span>&reg;</span>, the purpose-built data incident response management software from ID Experts<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;brings simplicity and efficiency to the management of privacy and security incidents. Today, ID Experts is releasing the new RADAR API that allows third-party applications&mdash;such as Security and Access Log Monitoring, Incident Detection and Ticketing&mdash;to create incidents in RADAR for regulatory risk assessment and tracking. Once an incident is created, organizations can use RADAR's patented Breach Guidance Engine<span>TM</span>&nbsp;to determine if the incident is a breach according to the complex maze of federal and state laws, provide guidance on notifications to individuals and regulatory agencies, and prove compliance.</p>
<p><strong>RADAR Offers Specialized Business Associate Workflow for Managing Incidents&nbsp;<br /></strong>Healthcare Business Associates (BAs) are facing increased regulatory and contractual obligations when assessing and responding to security and privacy incidents. RADAR's new workflow is designed for BAs&mdash;including health plans that serve as the third party administrator (TPA) and covered entities that are self-insured&mdash;to simplify the complexity of these obligations. This new purpose-built workflow allows health plans and business associates to efficiently manage these complex obligations using a secure and scalable platform to reduce risk and demonstrate compliance to regulators and their business clients.</p>
