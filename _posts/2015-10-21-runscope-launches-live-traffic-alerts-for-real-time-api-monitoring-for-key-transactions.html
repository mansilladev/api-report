Live Traffic Alerts can catch and notify you of the important API calls you make when they fail, like creating a lead in your CRM, charging a credit card, creating customers, webhook callbacks and more.</p>
<p>"Modern application infrastructure is evolving quickly, combining many different internal and external APIs and microservices. Understanding the performance characteristics of these services is crucial to delivering a quality user experience," said John Sheehan, Co-founder and CEO of Runscope. "With Live Traffic Alerts, developers can detect specific API call failures that can only be observed in production, reducing the time to resolution and minimizing lost revenue from breakages."</p>
