<p dir="ltr">Consumers rely on Yelp&rsquo;s trustworthy ratings, reviews, and accurate business details to make important decisions every day &ndash; finding a place to eat, selecting a handyman to help them fix up their home, or uncovering the best place to buy a gift. These days, you can also find the same great Yelp content in Apple products; Volvo, Mercedes Benz, and Toyota vehicles; third-party apps such as Eat24, Microsoft, Trulia, and Yahoo; and a variety of cutting-edge startups like AddressReport, DuckDuckGo, and Wildcard, just to mention a few. Today, we&rsquo;re excited to share that over 100,000 developers have registered to use the Yelp API to integrate Yelp data into their products.</p>
<p>Developers and partners of all shapes and sizes, from tiny startups to Fortune 500 companies, use the Yelp API to help their users make better decisions within their own apps. Trulia helps home seekers find the right home, in the right neighborhood. Providing consumers with a complete picture of the neighborhood &ndash; restaurants, grocery stores, and other amenities &ndash; is crucial in the home search process. So they integrated the Yelp API&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trulia.com/local/san-francisco-ca/type:restaurants_amenities">into their maps</a>, helping consumers identify their ideal neighborhood without leaving the Trulia app or website.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Yelp is committed to providing a robust and unparalleled local search experience via the Yelp API. Our goal is to make sure that every developer can get what they need in terms of local search and data to build, launch, and improve their apps. Whether tinkering with a side project, launching a new startup, scaling a company, or working at a large public company, Yelp will be a resource for all developers. In addition, for those who would love to use Yelp content but may not have the technical prowess to build something from scratch, don't worry. We will be launching &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; tools so that anyone can get the Yelp data they need to power their experiences.</p>
