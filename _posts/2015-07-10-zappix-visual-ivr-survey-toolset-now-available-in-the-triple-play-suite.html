<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="http://www.zappix.com">Zappix</a>, provider of the Triple Play Visual IVR platform announced, today the addition of a survey package to their SmartPhone IVR solution. The new package allows companies to easily create, distribute &amp; analyze surveys as part of the customer service experience. After each service interaction, these customizable surveys are delivered at a set time to users via a SmartPhone notification alert. .</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Able to be deployed in any IVR menu item, the flexible Zappix survey generates a Net Promoter Score that provides the ultimate test for any customer relationship metric.&rdquo; said Zappix Chairman, Avner Schneur.  &ldquo;This helps an organization tune its growth engine to operate at peak efficiency. The registering and analysis of NPS Promoters, Passives, and Detractors contributes significantly to  creating a successful customer-focused program and turning companies into Net Promoter stars. It also provides a best practice infrastructure for how companies collect, evaluate, and act on customer feedback to optimize and achieve long-term, profitable growth. Unlike independent survey systems,&rdquo; continued Schneur, &ldquo;the Zappix survey can be deployed immediately and automatically after a Visual IVR transaction to produce a clear measure of an organization's performance through its customers' eyes. The benefit is clear as recent  studies indicate that Net Promoter System leaders, on average, grow at more than twice the rate of their competitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Customer surveys are an important communication channel that provides invaluable, experiential-based customer touch points, &rdquo; said Gal Steinberg, Zappix VP Marketing. &ldquo;Through this new NPS survey offering, our Visual IVR customers have the robust capabilities needed to capture quantitative and qualitative user feedback that is tied to the context of the customer service interaction selected. The customer feedback, ratings and Net Promoter Score are all available through  the Zappix analytics package, which identifies and analyzes patterns in the results and offers systemic solutions to recurring issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Easy to implement at little cost and with no IT involvement, the Zappix platform provides access to both live (i.e.phone,  web chat) and  automated (forms, web, media, etc.) customer support options.  Companies using this Smartphone Visual IVR app realize significant reductions in app development costs while giving their customers an easier way to connect with customer service, on the phone, web or via self-service.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Recently, Zappix also announced the availability of the Zappix Smartphone Visual IVR for Human Resources. This empowering new web or native application connects employees with their company&rsquo;s Human Resources infrastructure, allowing them to view paychecks, manage a 401K account, update their health insurance plan and speak with an HR specialist via smartphone.</p>
