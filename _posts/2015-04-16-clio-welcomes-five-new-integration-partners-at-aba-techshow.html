<p>Software for lawyers continues to advance, with new services and functions emerging each month. Lawyers attending the American Bar Association&rsquo;s annual technology conference (ABA TECHSHOW), will get to see many company&rsquo;s offerings at once.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goclio.com/">Clio</a> has viewed this advancement with great excitement. New products and offerings have created a space for collaboration and cooperation. Clio continues to innovate in the legal technology by integrating their service with many other legal-specific technologies. Law firms can combine Clio with 25 other internet services directly and hundreds of others using Clio&rsquo;s API. Clio is the most integrated legal software available, letting lawyers choose their own tools rather than restricting them in a &ldquo;walled garden&rdquo; of incomplete modules and proprietary add-ons.</p>
<p>"Lawyers require different solutions depending on their focus and location. No single tool can cover every area of law,&rdquo; said Joshua Lenon, Clio&rsquo;s Lawyer in Residence. &ldquo;Clio&rsquo;s API ecosystem makes it easy for lawyers to use the tools specialized to their practice, in a platform that ties them together. It is something that you will not see in other practice management services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clio is proud to welcome these companies into their legal technology ecosystem:&nbsp;</p>

<li>Thread KM, a unique chat program for law firms where they can coordinate their case files; and</li>
