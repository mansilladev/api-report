<p><a href="http://www.touchcommerce.com">TouchCommerce</a>, the innovative leader in omni-channel customer engagement solutions for market leading brands, today announced that it has updated its Conversation Platform, specifically focusing on its flexible integration framework and APIs. As a result, TouchCommerce customers and their end-users will benefit from new integration capabilities and rapid deployment. One example is the ability for enterprise customers to add the TouchCommerce live chat experience to any of their native mobile apps. Another example is the formalized capacity to integrate with third party APIs for reading from and writing to any external service. The updates to the TouchCommerce Conversation Platform provide further advancements in the seamless and consistent customer experience in multistage service interactions across channels, systems and organizations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"As the core foundation of our technology ecosystem, the TouchCommerce Conversation Platform enables various technologies and areas of operation to interconnect effortlessly in order to help brands engage their customers on any channel, anytime, anywhere," said Bernard Louvat, president and CEO of TouchCommerce. "With our latest updates, the customer experience we have developed integrates even more easily with brands' existing systems and is more flexible on the back-end for helping brands understand, serve and convert their customers."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Key APIs and integration framework components have been defined and implemented across the following areas of the TouchCommerce Conversation Platform:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> RightTouch Flexible Integration Framework -- This framework allows enterprises to rapidly integrate available client and third party data into the RightTouch system. The latest release focuses on advancing how third party content is displayed to customers and agents within the RightTouch user experience (UX). </li>
<li> Customer and Agent Engagement APIs -- By defining formal communication between any interface in which a customer is chatting and the RightTouch engine, the APIs enable third parties to integrate the TouchCommerce live chat and agent console functionality into their applications (e.g., mobile apps, ATMs, etc.). The recent enhancements ease and expedite this integration for TouchCommerce clients and partners, providing for a better user experience.</li>
<li> Invitation API - This API can be leveraged to generate custom invitations to be displayed via any medium, leading to a chat engagement, an automated guide, a video, or a targeted offer connecting consumer journey touchpoints. The latest updates streamline the highly targeted RightTouch engagement experience across all channels as well as extend the targeting capabilities of the TouchCommerce platform beyond online engagement.</li>
<li> Reporting API - This API provides users with the ability to extract - in real-time - a rich set of RightTouch engagement metrics (i.e. targeted, engaged, converted) and transcript (conversation) data into external systems. The latest release can be used to integrate TouchCommerce data with a wide variety of reporting applications and dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">TouchCommerce customers have already started incorporating the updated Conversation Platform into their customer engagement infrastructure for fast and flexible deployment. Some customers have even taken on development to test ideas and/or achieve specific integration objectives. The in-app mobile live chat capability has been a popular topic of discussion with clients -- many have existing mobile apps with which they would like to integrate the TouchCommerce live chat user experience and targeting capabilities. In another instance, a major telco client has recently started using the Customer Engagement API to incorporate RightTouch live chat functionality and reporting into their own SMS system. In this instance, end-user chats are routed through the API into the TouchCommerce RightTouch engine, which assigns the chat session to an agent. The chat response is then routed back through the SMS gateway and delivered back to customer as an SMS.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The continuous evolution of the TouchCommerce Conversation Platform plays an important role in helping clients reduce interaction costs, increase sales, and maximize end-user satisfaction by providing open, flexible, connected and integrated framework for intuitive engagement with the brand throughout consumers&rsquo; omni-channel journey.
