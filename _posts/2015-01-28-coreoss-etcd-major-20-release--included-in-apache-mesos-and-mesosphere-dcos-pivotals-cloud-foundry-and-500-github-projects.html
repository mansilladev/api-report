<p><a href="https://coreos.com/" target="_blank">CoreOS</a>&nbsp;today announced that etcd, a key component that helps companies achieve Google-like infrastructure, has made its first major stable release. Already used in projects such as Apache Mesos and Mesosphere DCOS, Google's Kubernetes, Pivotal's Cloud Foundry and more than 500 other projects, etcd is a key building block for building distributed systems.</p>
<p>"Shared configuration and shared state are two very tricky domains for distributed systems developers as services no longer run on one machine but are coordinated across an entire datacenter," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Benjamin Hindman</span>, chief architect at Mesosphere and chair of Apache Mesos. "Apache Mesos and Mesosphere's Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) will soon have a standard plugin to support etcd. Users and customers have asked for etcd support, and we're delivering it as an option."</p>
<p>etcd is an open source, distributed, consistent key-value store for shared configuration, service discovery, and scheduler coordination. By using etcd, applications can ensure that even in the face of individual servers failing, the application will continue to work. etcd is a core component of CoreOS software that facilitates safe automatic updates, coordinates work being scheduled to hosts, and sets up overlay networking for containers.</p>
<p>"etcd is an important part of configuration management and service discovery in our infrastructure," said Sasha Klizhentas, lead engineer at Mailgun. "Our services use etcd for dynamic load-balancing, leader election and canary deployment patterns. etcd's simple HTTP API helps make our infrastructure reliable and distributed."</p>
<p>"We evaluated a number of persistent stores, yet etcd's HTTP API and strong Go client support was the best fit for Cloud Foundry," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Onsi Fakhouri</span>, engineering manager at Pivotal. "Anyone currently running a recent version of Cloud Foundry is running etcd. We are big fans of etcd and are excited to see the rapid progress behind the key-value store."</p>
<p>etcd is written in Go which has excellent cross-platform support, small binaries and a great community behind it. The project is Apache 2.0 licensed and is developed by CoreOS and a community of open source developers. Internally etcd uses the Raft consensus algorithm to enable fault-tolerance and the distributed replication of information.</p>
<p>"Our goal with etcd has been to make building and using distributed systems easier, and I think we have done it," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Brandon Philips</span>, CTO of CoreOS. "A big thank you to the community that has helped us work on etcd. This is a component that will help drive forward various projects to make infrastructure stronger and highly-available."</p>
