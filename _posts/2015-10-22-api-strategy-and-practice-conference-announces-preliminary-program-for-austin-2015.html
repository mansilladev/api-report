<p>The <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference (APIStrat)</a> has announced the preliminary program for the API industry event in Austin, Texas to be held&nbsp;November 18-20, 2015. Taming API complexity, investing in platform business models, solving the emerging challenges of microservices, and sharing real-world success of shepherding APIs though the enterprise are some of the talks to be presented.</p>
<p>We have an exciting and forward-thinking program in place for API Strategy and Practice,&rdquo; said Steven Willmott, CEO of 3scale, one of the co-organizers (with API Evangelist) of the event. Our speakers are all at the forefront of implementing best practices and have struggled through some of the challenges of today&rsquo;s tech environment to share their solutions and experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the API space matures, we are seeing many businesses taking up industry best practices. This conference represents a turning point where the problems and challenges are becoming harder to solve because as leaders break new ground, there are no precedents for what best practice looks like. We are astounded by the generosity of speakers willing to share their progress and their failures with our audience and to demonstrate what the next wave of API innovation will look like,&rdquo; Willmott said.</p>
<p>We are also very proud to tap into some of the Austin API community&rsquo;s leadership with talks from local industry champions presenting in some of the key discussions around API design, microservices and testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Focusing on the stories and experiences of implementing APIs is a recurring theme amongst API Strategy and Practice speakers and keynotes. Keynotes like enterprise thought leader Dion Hinchcliffe will share stories on how a new generation of citizen developers are accessing APIs to enhance product design and build more efficient business processes. Ashley Hathaway from IBM is an expert storyteller describing the tech journey from holistic idea to tactile execution. Lori MacVittie from F5 Networks will share stories on the implementation of emerging technologies, powered by APIs. And Neha Sampat, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="http://built.io/" target="_blank">Built.io</a>&nbsp;will present a number of examples that demonstrate how businesses and enterprises are utilizing the Internet of Things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Program session themes include API definitions, design best practices, managing real-time messaging protocols, API marketing and developer relations, APIs for the Internet of Things, and how to foster innovation in the enterprise. 13 session tracks will be hosted over the two days, with over 80 speakers presenting, alongside&nbsp;a sponsor's area, hack-zone and themed API tutorial sessions.</p>
<p>The API Strategy &amp; Practice conference takes the comfort, safety and inclusiveness of everyone involved in the event very seriously. All attendees are required to adhere to a code of conduct to insure that everyone is free to enjoy the collaborative environment the conference strives to foster. Additionally, the event is vendor neutral, meaning topics are not product or brand-centric.</p>
