<p><a href="https://musescore.org/">MuseScore</a>, a popular and actively developed program for editing, playing and printing sheet music, has reached a new milestone with the release of MuseScore 2.0. The previous release of the MuseScore software has been downloaded over eight million times.</p>
<p>MuseScore 2.0 aims to capture an even wider audience through the addition of key new features, including support for guitar tablature and linked part editing, which is particularly useful for creating orchestral scores. Import and export capabilities have also been improved with support for Guitar Pro&reg; import, and improved MusicXML&trade; import and export.</p>
<p>Over a five-year period, more than 400 people contributed to the development of MuseScore 2.0, a 30% increase over the 1.0 release. Due to the software's open-source license and gratis download, MuseScore has been something of a revolutionary force, leading to the democratization of the music notation software and sheet music industries. Similar proprietary products include Sibelius&reg; and Finale&reg;.</p>
<p>The MuseScore software can connect with MuseScore.com, a fast-growing community of sheet music creators, letting users share their scores with a wider audience and giving musicians an extraordinary access to original compositions and arrangements. In addition, the MuseScore mobile application for iOS and Android helps musicians practice and perform digital sheet music on the go.</p>
<p>MuseScore 2.0 is available now as a free download for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9tdXNlc2NvcmUub3Jn">https://musescore.org</a></p>
