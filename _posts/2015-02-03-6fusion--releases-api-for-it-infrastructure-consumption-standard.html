<p><a href="http://www.6fusion.com/">6fusion</a>, the company standardizing the economic measurement of IT infrastructure and cloud services, today announced the release of its first public Application Programing Interface (API). The new API enables seamless integration with the 6fusion UC6 Platform creating new product and service opportunities for ecosystem partners based on the Workload Allocation Cube (WAC), the patented unit of measure for IT infrastructure consumption.</p>
<p>6fusion now provides independent software vendors (ISVs), cloud infrastructure suppliers, channel partners, and enterprise customers, with an open API to create and deliver new software applications and solutions that integrate with the UC6 Platform. The API accelerates the development and advancement of an organized market for IT infrastructure by broadening access to critical data that informs market price discovery, helps quantify supply and demand, and enables the transparency necessary to improve economic decision making around IT infrastructure investment planning. The API also enhances the value of IT financial management and decision support tools by enabling programmatic integration of WAC data into existing reporting processes and data models.</p>
<p>"Organizing the global IT infrastructure services market means empowering the buyer to make supportable financial decisions with well informed data. Our public API release marks an important milestone,&rdquo; said John Cowan, 6fusion CEO and Co-Founder.</p>
<p>Early support for the API comes from beta customers such as&nbsp;<a href="http://ucxchange.com/">UCX, The Universal Compute Xchange</a>, which leverages the new API to enable physical delivery of traded computing contracts. &ldquo;The 6fusion API is critical to our information supply chain and in particular, our delivery process,&rdquo; said Adam Zeck, UCX CEO and Founder. &ldquo;We see this as just the beginning of creating capital efficiencies for the market to trade WAC Financial Products via our centralized exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6fusion has designed the API to simplify integration with the UC6 Platform. Based on the Hypertext Application Language (HAL) specification, the API is flexible, simple to use, and standards driven. The API is comprehensive, supporting all features and capabilities found in the 6fusion user interface, and includes interactive documentation to assist developers with integration.</p>
