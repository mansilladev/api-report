<p>Aggregators, publishers and other content providers can now get their products to market faster, reduce costs, and provide a better user experience to worldwide library users. Boopsie, Inc., the leading mobile platform-as-a-service provider for libraries, today announced&nbsp;AccessILS(&trade;), a newly available Platform-as-a-Service that combines robust and responsive technology with innovative services to enable digital content providers to libraries and their users to easily and efficiently integrate their content with major ILS&rsquo;.&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib29wc2llLmNvbS9ib29wc2llLWxhdW5jaGVzLWFjY2Vzc2lscy1wbGF0Zm9ybS10by1zdHJlYW1saW5lLWludGVncmF0aW9uLW9mLWRpZ2l0YWwtYW5kLXBoeXNpY2FsLXJlc291cmNlcy1mb3ItbGlicmFyaWVzLw==">AccessILS allows library industry content providers</a>&nbsp;struggling with developing technology to integrate their digital catalogs with the legacy systems used by thousands of library systems worldwide to manage their physical catalogues. E-Content providers are using Boopsie&rsquo;s AccessILS to eliminate the cost and development time previously required to utilize legacy APIs for each disparate system, some of which are incomplete or outdated. Boopsie has performed over 1000 such library system integrations to date and has decided to make this Platform-as-a-Service available to its partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In working with libraries and vendors for more than five years, we realized that integrating with a wide range of Integrated Library Systems is an expensive and daunting task. In many cases, content providers that use third party technology are required to be certified and pay expensive license fees for APIs with limited functionality. Content focused companies that develop their own proprietary APIs are often unable to support all systems &ndash; especially older ones &ndash; requiring libraries to upgrade in order to serve user needs,&rdquo; said Tony Medrano, CEO of Boopsie. &ldquo;AccessILS removes ILS barriers to content distribution, enabling companies with digital catalogues to deliver more value, better engage users with targeted, relevant content and recommendations, and provide higher levels of service with their existing systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We added iVerse&rsquo;s ComicPlus to our Boopsie powered mobile app. This allowed seamless check out of digital comics and graphic novels and we saw a substantial increase in checkouts,&rdquo; said Saima Kadir, manager of Virtual Library Services at Houston Public Library.</p>
<p>Available as a cloud-based service targeted at both desktop and mobile solutions, AccessILS enables platform level functionality well beyond the limited simple check out feature provided by other third party APIs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single view of their digital and non-digital holdings&nbsp;</li>
<li>Information regarding holds, history and patron information&nbsp;</li>
<li>Integrated book cover imaged&nbsp;</li>
<li>Full category search&nbsp;</li>
<li>Much more</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Boopsie&rsquo;s team of experts work with&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="Boopsie Star Partners" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib29wc2llLmNvbS9ib29wc2llLXN0YXJzLw==">content providers in the library industry</a>&nbsp;to ensure smooth API deployment, enabling them to spend more time on critical business functions like selling, product development, and improving the user experience. For example, the Boopsie team will work with libraries to determine technical requirements and identify the library&rsquo;s exact ILS vendor, version and feature set. Boopsie will then determine if the ILS module exists in its technical catalog, and if it does not, Boopsie will build a new module. Boopsie also offers its mobile Platform-as-a-Service to libraries in need of better engaging their users with&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="We Build Library-Branded Apps for Libraries" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib29wc2llLmNvbS93ZS1idWlsZC1hcHBzLWZvci1saWJyYXJpZXMv">library-branded native mobile apps</a>&nbsp;on all major mobile platforms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;A true solution requires both innovative technology and expert services to make deployment easy for our partners and frequent use easy for library users,&rdquo; said Medrano. &ldquo;By leveraging our experience in uniting the catalogues and content of our partners with library systems and extending our patented technology beyond mobile applications, Boopsie is helping the industry move towards a more united, efficient future.&rdquo;</em></p>
