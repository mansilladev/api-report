<p><a href="http://www.tapclicks.com">TapClicks</a>' flagship marketing analytics platform, TapAnalytics, continues to lead the marketing dashboard industry with release 5.5 - adding a new custom datafeed import function, new widgets and widget enhancements, a variety of ease-of-use features and the addition of new partner integrations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">TapAnalytics pulls data from a variety of pre-built data sources, typically through APIs. Sometimes, a client may need to include other data that is not readily available through an API, for example, data sourced from an internal system, an external system without public web service, or data that is simply captured manually in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">TapAnalytics 5.5 now offers "Custom Services" -- an easy way for customers to build their own data pipes to bring data into the TapAnalytics platform.  This new feature takes advantage of standard transfer and storage mechanisms -- FTP, SFTP, Google Drive and DropBox -- to enable client-friendly transfer of files on a schedule.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Users can now enjoy the benefits of creating their own automated datafeeds and combine them with the other services they use in TapAnalytics, without the need for creating complex APIs or spending time building one-off manual feeds.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Data is everywhere now,&rdquo; said Michael Mertz, TapClicks' vice-president of product management. &ldquo;The new custom integration wizard provides huge benefits, making it easy to load and combine data from internal, external and offline sources.  Now, our customers can focus on their core competencies of analytics and reporting, not wasting time writing complex APIs or doing one-off manual uploads."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>New Text Widgets</strong><br />TapAnalytics 5.5 also enables marketing managers to create enhanced widget dashboards using the new Text Widgets.  Reports need context - especially with changes to campaigns. Text Widgets provide dashboard-specific notes, giving you the power to add contextual data to dashboards. Describe changes to services, call out Big Wins and help guide users with widget-based dashboard insights.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>New Service Integrations</strong><br />Keeping with the goal of providing the most comprehensive and flexible platform on the market, TapAnalytics 5.5 has added the following marketing services to its integration offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li>CallSource&nbsp;</li>
