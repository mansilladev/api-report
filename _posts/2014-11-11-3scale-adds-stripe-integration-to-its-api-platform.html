<p>The API management platform <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2014/11/announcing-stripe-integration/">3Scale has announced that it has integrated the popular Stripe payment option into its Power, Pro and Enterprise plans</a>, allowing customers an easy option for managing developer payments. The ability to monetize APIs is crucial to many providers and this solution makes that aspect of API management much easier. Stripe is widely used among API providers and the new 3scale Stripe integration allows them to process payments with the solution they prefer. API providers can select Stripe as a payment option, configure it quickly in the admin console and launch their API offering in record time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no question that more and more companies and organizations are seeing the value of sharing their data assets and resources with developers as APIs become mainstream,&rdquo; said Steve Willmott, CEO of 3scale. &ldquo;Getting all that great data out there for re-use with the API itself as business model is the key - and this integration makes that extremely easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stripe is a developer-friendly way to accept payments online. The company processes billions of dollars a year for thousands of companies of all sizes across both desktop and mobile applications. Using the 3scale Stripe integration, customers don&rsquo;t have to design a payment flow from scratch. Instead they can take advantage of a 3scale flow proven by customers running their paid API programs on the platform. Also, because 3scale is PCI compliant, API providers don&rsquo;t have to deal with PCI headaches before charging for their API.</p>
<p>"Using the 3scale Stripe integration eliminates the hassles and hurdles of setting up a merchant account,&rdquo; said Travis Todd, a co-founder of FullContact. "Creating a Stripe account and connecting it to your 3Scale account takes minutes, allowing you to monetize your API right away. Anyone that has gone through the process of setting up a merchant account will have a real appreciation for this integration."</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited about working with 3Scale to support the API economy and provide a simple way for businesses to charge for the APIs they build,&rdquo; said John Collison, president and co-founder of Stripe.</p>
