<p>We keep adding new APIs to MeaningCloud to help you extract meaning from unstructured content in various business scenarios.<br /><br /><strong>Corporate Reputation analysis&nbsp;</strong>is one of them. Customers wish to understand the public's perceptions around certain dimensions of their companies: financial situation, quality of products, social responsibility... And they need to extend the analysis to the huge volume of spontaneous opinions that users express in social media.<br /><br />MeaningCloud's new&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/products-corporate-reputation-/3797sv/706704223" target="_blank"><strong>Corporate Reputation API</strong></a>&nbsp;enables to factor&nbsp;<strong>any text taken from social networks, forums, blogs, news,</strong>&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;into the analysis&nbsp;with a high level of granularity and precision, in real time. Read the&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/developer-corporate-reputation/3797sx/706704223" target="_blank">documentation here</a>.<br /><br />In addition, we used the opportunity of this MeaningCloud update to migrate two APIs from our previous product, Textalytics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/oper-lemmatization-pos-parsing/3797sz/706704223" target="_blank"><strong>Lemmatization, PoS and Parsing</strong></a>. Performs linguistic analysis in several languages, determining the lemma and the morphosyntactic analysis of each word (Part of Speech tagging), and the syntactic analysis of sentences based on constituents.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/oper-lemmatization-pos-parsing/3797sz/706704223" target="_blank">Read more</a>..</li>
<li><a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/developer-text-proofreading/3797t2/706704223" target="_blank"><strong>Text Proofreading</strong></a>. Automatically detects spelling, grammar, and style mistakes in several languages.&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/developer-text-proofreading/3797t2/706704223" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Those of you who are still using the APIs of our former service Textalytics now have more reasons to definitely move to MeaningCloud. The migration is immediate following&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.daedalus.es/e/3322/checker-language-analysis-api-/3797t4/706704223" target="_blank">these simple instructions</a>.</p>
