She will also focus on supporting developer relationships, assisting them with Tradier&rsquo;s integration onto their platforms and helping them realize business growth and product expansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We actively work with entrepreneurs, businesses, developers and active traders to solve their trading and brokerage challenges by delivering an un-paralleled integrated trading experience. Rio&rsquo;s extensive retail investor and trading technology marketing expertise will further secure our position as the leading brokerage API in the market. We are looking forward to Rio&rsquo;s leadership to take the company&rsquo;s digital and co-marketing programs to the next level.&rdquo; said Dan Raju, CEO and Co-Founder of Tradier, Inc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have quickly witnessed rapid adoption of our brokerage API by an extraordinarily diverse group. The trading and online brokerage marketplace continues to evolve and I am thrilled to be a part of an innovative company that, in the short time since its launch, is already redefining the brokerage paradigm,&rdquo; said Slaven. &ldquo;I believe in Tradier&rsquo;s cloud technology and how it empowers our partners &ndash; the fin-tech entities, forward-thinking developers, data and tool providers, as well as quant traders -- and allows them to access and manage their trading needs on their own terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slaven is a seasoned marketer and digital strategist with a track record of leading full-scale marketing programs for start-up, high-growth, and turnaround businesses in the financial services arena. She has lent her expertise to large online brokers and financial services companies including TD Ameritrade, E*Trade Financial and Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Raju added, &ldquo;Rio believes in our mission to accelerate a new brokerage model &ndash; moving away from the traditional disjointed trading experience to one that is a seamless ecosystem, allowing integrators, their subscribers, and traders to access trading from their preferred platform without leaving it. She is already achieving great strides &ndash; working with our partners to help them offer and launch expanded service offerings to their customers.&rdquo;</p>
