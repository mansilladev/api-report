<p><a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> and i8c today announced a strategic partnership to deliver business integration solutions to companies of all sizes in Belgium. The partnership combines i8c&rsquo;s more than 10 years of experience in the business integration domain with WSO2&rsquo;s proven, open source, cloud-enabled middleware platform. Together, the companies are providing customers in Belgium with a flexible and composable middleware platform for integrating their administrative IT applications on-premises, in the cloud, on mobile devices&mdash;internally and with external partners.</p>
<p>WSO2 delivers the industry&rsquo;s most comprehensive open source platform for building, integrating, managing, securing and analyzing companies&rsquo; APIs, applications, and Web services&mdash;on-premises, in the cloud, on mobile devices, and across the Internet of Things. i8c leverages its extensive integration expertise, obtained at midsize to large enterprise customers active in various business domains, such as finance, insurance, utilities, pharmaceuticals and government, in the Belgian market.</p>
<p>The partnership was announced in conjunction with WSO2&rsquo;s news at WSO2Con Europe 2015 today that the company has achieved a 155% growth in partner-driven revenue in Q1 2015 over Q1 2014.</p>
<p>Under terms of the agreement, i8c will use WSO2&rsquo;s open source middleware to provide customers with local professional services that cover all aspects of their business integration projects: consultancy (assessments, architectural blueprinting, performance and quality audits), implementation (design, build, test, deploy) and managed services (support and monitoring, outsourcing, hosting). Additionally, WSO2 will provide i8c with technical, sales and marketing support to promote adoption and help customers achieve the high availability, high performance, and flexibility they require for IT and business agility.</p>
