Trends highlight the Internet of Things (IoT) as a driver for increased spending as well as the need for cloud and on-premise connectivity for integration projects, forcing a hybrid integration model.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Integration is the &lsquo;new black&rsquo; for the Internet of Things, the critical core of tying together applications,&rdquo; said Mark Herring, senior vice president of product marketing, Software AG. &ldquo;The heart of communication from the Internet of Things lies in integration technology and 2015 will be the year its importance reaches new heights in the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bwcellpmargin"><strong>Integration of Things:</strong>&nbsp;IoT is the biggest driver for integration technology since the advent of the Internet. New Thing-smart integration techniques will evolve leading integration platforms&rsquo; capabilities that include real-time streaming, bursty traffic, high frequency updates and integration software that embeds in the devices themselves, as well as in collection hubs and centralized &ldquo;brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bwcellpmargin"><strong>Spend, baby, spend:</strong>&nbsp;IoT and Software as a Service (SaaS) will drive a 33 percent increase in corporate spending on integration technology in 2015, according to an independent research firm. The proliferation of devices and IoT spending will become the main driver, replacing last year&rsquo;s SaaS dominance.</p>
