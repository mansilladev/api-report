<p><a href="http://www.talend.com/">Talend</a>, the global&nbsp;big data&nbsp;integration software leader, today unveiled&nbsp;<a href="http://www.talend.com/products/integration-cloud">Talend Integration Cloud</a>, a powerful new solution to extend and advance the data-driven enterprise. Available in early Q2, the hosted cloud integration platform provides instant, elastic and secure capacity so IT teams can easily shift workloads between on-premises and the cloud, increasing agility, performance and productivity, while lowering operational costs. Talend Integration Cloud provides a single solution for bulk, batch and real-time data integration across hundreds of data sources, including Hadoop, Amazon Redshift and NoSQL databases.</p>

<p>A major challenge for companies is uniting data that is currently trapped in individual silos. Compounding the problem is the fact that the majority of new integration flows are extending beyond the firewall, meaning integration processes need to run anywhere across a hybrid environment that includes on-premises centers as well as private or public clouds. Talend Integration Cloud allows IT to use the full power of Talend Studio and apply more than 800 connectors and components to simplify development of cloud-to-cloud and hybrid integration flows that can be deployed as governed integration services.</p>
<p>Using the new web-based designer and pre-built components from the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fexchange.talend.com&amp;esheet=51064480&amp;newsitemid=20150324005185&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Talend+Exchange&amp;index=4&amp;md5=d1a9989e4ca39f83d64a75fb0947d8ad" target="_blank">Talend Exchange</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an online community for sharing cloud templates, components and best practices &ndash; users can efficiently extract, cleanse, enrich and share data between thousands of applications and data sources. Supported sources include Marketo, NetSuite, Salesforce, Redshift, SAP, AWS S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, email and FTP. Talend Integration Cloud also offers capabilities for easily de-duplicating and standardizing data to help increase information accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are fundamental shifts happening in IT that are changing the requirements around how and what companies need to integrate,&rdquo; said Laurent Bride, CTO, Talend. &ldquo;Many IT and business users still lack the agility to make faster and better decisions. Our new platform empowers IT to extend the data-driven enterprise by unifying their data, while operating in real-time and acting with insight. With the ability to be live in seconds, the platform combines an easy-to-use web user interface for quickly building and managing integration flows with the power of Talend Studio for creating robust data governance rules and complex integration flows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fast analytics requires quick access to accurate data. Talend Integration Cloud takes advantage of the massively parallel environment of Hadoop through native and optimized code generation. When integrating big data systems such as Amazon Redshift or Amazon EMR, Talend Integration Cloud enables users to run integration jobs when and where they are needed for the best response time, lowest latency and most cost-effective use of resources. There is no need to download data that is already stored in the cloud and native integration is included with cloud-based big data and analytics platforms. Talend Integration Cloud connects to all Hadoop and NoSQL sources and automatically generates native MapReduce, Spark or Storm code to run in cloud or on-premises Hadoop distributions.</p>
<p>Infogroup is a marketing services and analytics provider offering data and software-as-a-service to help a range of companies, including FORTUNE 100<span>&trade;</span>&nbsp;enterprises, increase sales and customer loyalty. The company provides both digital and traditional marketing channel expertise that is enhanced by real-time client access to proprietary data on 235 million individuals and 24 million businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We use Talend&rsquo;s big data and data integration products to help our customers access vast amounts of contextually-relevant data in real-time, so they can be more responsive to their client&rsquo;s demands,&rdquo; said Purandar Das, chief technology officer, Enterprise Solutions, Infogroup. &ldquo;Our work requires that we constantly innovate and perfect the systems driving topline revenue for clients. Talend Integration Cloud, which we&rsquo;ve been beta testing for the past several weeks, will enable us to integrate more data from more cloud and mobile sources leveraging our existing skills and prior Talend project work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In winter 2015, Talend Integration Cloud becomes a single platform for batch and real-time integration. Connect, mediate, and orchestrate services in the cloud or on the ground to deliver data in real-time to take action immediately. In addition, a new API Gateway will make it easy to create and extend policies to cloud, mobile and partner applications, increasing productivity while enforcing data governance policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new Talend Integration Cloud with its batch, bulk and real time data integrations, and initial support for big data integration, rounds out Talend&rsquo;s offerings to compete broadly in the growing iPaaS market,&rdquo; said Carl Lehmann, hybrid IT analyst at 451 Research. &ldquo;While developers and users will find value in its web-based design tool&rsquo;s testing and preview capabilities, IT executives are likely to be interested in Talend&rsquo;s product roadmap that is vectoring to support continuous integration and delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Talend Integration Cloud will be available in early Q2 from Talend&rsquo;s website. A number of solution versions will be available, including SaaS, Hybrid and Elastic offerings varying feature sets and subscription options to best meet a variety of customers&rsquo; project types and budget. A free trail is available for Talend Integration Cloud for SaaS. The platform may also be procured through the usual Talend representatives and partners.
