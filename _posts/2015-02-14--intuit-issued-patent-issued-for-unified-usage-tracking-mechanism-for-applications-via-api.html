<p>The <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/">Quickbooks accounting API platform Intuit</a> was recently <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/patog/week05/OG/html/1411-1/US08949865-20150203.html">granted a patent for unified usage tracking for applications via an API</a>. Here is the abstract for the patent:</p>
<p>A system comprising: a computer processor; a tracking engine executing on the computer processor and configured to: retrieve a translation engine from a translation engine provider system, detect a passive user-generated action has occurred and an active user-generated action has occurred, generate a first pre-translated event for the passive user generated action using a translation engine application programming interfaces (APIs), and generate a second pre-translated event for the active user-generated action using the translation engine APIs; and a translation engine executing on the computer processor and configured to: translate the first pre-translated event and the second pre-translated event to obtain a first translated events, wherein the first translated events are in a first format associated with a first tracking system, translate the first pre-translated event and the second pre-translated event to obtain a second translated events, wherein the second translated events are in a second format associated with a second tracking system, prepare the first translated events for transmission to the first tracking system, prepare the second translated events for transmission to the second tracking system, send the first translated events to the first tracking system, and send the second translated events to the second tracking system.</p>
