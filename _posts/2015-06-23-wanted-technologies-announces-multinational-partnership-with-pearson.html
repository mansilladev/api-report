<p><a href="http://www.wantedanalytics.com">WANTED Technologies</a>, a leading provider of real-time market intelligence and analytics for staffing and talent sourcing professionals, today announced a long term multinational partnership agreement with Pearson, the world's leading learning company. Under terms of the agreement, Pearson will integrate WANTED&rsquo;s job market analytics and intelligence tool into Acclaim, the leading online digital badging platform, to issue, verify and share resume-worthy credentials, skills and learning achievements.  Professionals and badge-issuers working with Acclaim to recognize, share and verify achievements will gain a real-time look into employers currently hiring for those specific skills and certifications. Acclaim will access WANTED&rsquo;s multinational online platform, WANTED Analytics&trade;, and integrate WANTED&rsquo;s global API into the Acclaim platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are pleased that Pearson has chosen WANTED Technologies to provide up-to-the-moment, practical information about the market demand for specific skills and certifications,&rdquo; said Meredith Amdur, President and CEO of WANTED Technologies. &ldquo;This partnership will create new levels of connection and value among employers, certified talent, and industry groups. Pearson VUE has made Acclaim a trusted source of talent with verified skills.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Jonell Sanchez, Vice President, Global Employability and Career Success in Workforce Readiness at Pearson, said, &ldquo;As a global company, we appreciate the availability of key global data provided by WANTED. The partnerships they hold with local and national government agencies afford Pearson access to the kind of information, within a high performance infrastructure, that will positively impact the learners who rely on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About the Agreement</strong><br />WANTED has collected and analyzed online job ads for more than ten years to model the available talent pools in each country, by occupation, skill or certification, location, and level of experience. This data enables HR teams and staffing firms to create workforce strategies on local and global levels. HR professionals can determine where talent is located internationally, if and how a relocation strategy should be considered, and where to open new offices based on workforce accessibility. In addition, analysts in business and Government use the insights from WANTED to make strategic decisions in finance, economic development, and educational policy.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With this agreement, WANTED Analytics and the API will be integrated into Pearson&rsquo;s digital badging platform, Acclaim. This will give the community of associations, academic institutions and test owners using the platform the ability to see the hiring demand for the skill or certification they offer, enabling them to better calibrate their programs to meet real market demand. Additionally, Pearson will subscribe to WANTED Analytics International, which will provide access to skill and certification hiring trends for over 20 countries.</p>
