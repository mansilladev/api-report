<p><a href="http://www.adeptia.com">Adeptia, Inc.</a>, the leading provider of business-to-business (B2B) data connectivity and integration for non-technical users, today announced updates to Adeptia Connect, the industry&rsquo;s first integration platform that gives business users the ability to create connections with other companies for the purpose of exchanging critical business information. The updates to Adeptia Connect include shared connections in the Adeptia Connect Library and a streamlined user interface. The updates also provide an additional layer of protection for sensitive data through its Secure Engine, which offers Information Technology (I.T.) staff greater security and control of the self-service platform.</p>
<p>The latest updates to Adeptia Connect make it even simpler for business users to effectively manage their own connections so that they can onboard customers and access data faster, without the added cost and time of going through a technical IT resource. Through the Shared Connections Library, business users can create connections directly to their customers and partners using hundreds of pre-defined templates.</p>
<p>These added benefits can all be experienced without IT having to worry about unintentional exposure of valuable data exposure because of the additional control of the Secure Engine. Customers can now choose to run all connections from their own on-premise servers, instead of Adeptia&rsquo;s Multi-Tenant Environment. In such cases, customer data remains in the user&rsquo;s own environment and never goes into the Adeptia Connect cloud, enhancing IT control and security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When service providers bring on a new customer, they must take in an initial amount of information about that customer in order to provide their services to them,&rdquo; said Deepak Singh, president and chief technology officer at Adeptia. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen this process take up to 18 weeks, involving custom coding, meetings between two IT departments, and the creating of point-to-point integrations. We are eliminating the need for all that by making it dirt-simple for business users to set up their own data connections, reducing integration time from months to minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additional updates to Adeptia Connect include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Secure Bridge: Provides the ability for customers to securely connect internal, on-premises applications to Adeptia Connect.</li>
<li> Enhanced IT Control: Allows IT staff to manage the self-service platform. This includes the ability to lock connections, which only allows authorized users to make edits. In addition, it provides improved handling of error connections, such as the ability to re-run connections.</li>
<li> New App Connectors: Added APIs include Hubspot, Shopify, Freshbooks, Xero, Zoho CRM, Zendesk, Magento, Concur and BigCommerce.</li>
<li> Personalization: Users can customize the look of Adeptia Connect by utilizing their own branding within the platform.</li>
</ul>
