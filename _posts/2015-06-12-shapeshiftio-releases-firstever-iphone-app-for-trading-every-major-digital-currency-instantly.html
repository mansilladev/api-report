<p><a href="https://shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift.io</a>, the best way to instantly exchange bitcoin and other digital currencies, today announced that its platform is now available on the iPhone, making it the first such exchange to offer an iOS app for trading every major digital asset at the touch of a button. Users will now be able to trade Bitcoin with Monero, Counterparty, Dash and other altcoins at lightning quick speed anywhere they take their iPhone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since inception, ShapeShift has changed what is expected of altcoin exchanges. Having a presence on mobile is a crucial step in our roadmap for delivering the most frictionless experience possible while working at the speed of digital currency,&rdquo; said ShapeShift.io Founder and CEO Erik Voorhees.</p>
<p>Already available as an online exchange and API, ShapeShift&rsquo;s app allows users to trade bitcoin with other assets from the convenience of their iPhone without requiring an account, username, password, or email address, unlike traditional exchanges. This model provides superior consumer protection as it doesn&rsquo;t warehouse sensitive private information. &ldquo;Shifting&rdquo; coins is a no-hassle process, with users selecting the desired digital asset or coin, specifying the payout address, and experiencing the conversion only moments after their deposit is received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most exchanges hold customer funds and extract personal information, which is an archaic and insecure model,&rdquo; added Voorhees. &ldquo;Mt. Gox was a teachable moment for everyone in the Bitcoin community and ShapeShift has innovated these problems out of the picture. We are both faster and more secure. This is real consumer protection - no funds or sensitive information is stored on our servers nor on the user&rsquo;s phone in case it is damaged, destroyed or stolen. Digital currency has brought to humanity a more secure infrastructure, and so we build in that spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ShapeShift recently saw integrations with leading digital currency companies Purse.io and Vaultoro, which enable users to buy goods on Amazon or trade cryptocurrency for bullion, respectively.</p>
