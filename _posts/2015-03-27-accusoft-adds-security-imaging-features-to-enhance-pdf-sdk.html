<p><strong>Rendering PDFs Beyond the 72dpi Defaul</strong>t<br />PDFXpress now provides an API that allows developers the ability to retrieve the resolution of the page, this is important for pages that don&rsquo;t use the 72 dpi default. This empowers the app to correctly display the image and for image editing features like cropping and zooming to interact appropriately with the rendered image.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PDFXpress provides the tools the development community needs to create high-functioning, competitive PDF applications,&rdquo; said Accusoft President Jack Berlin.</p>
