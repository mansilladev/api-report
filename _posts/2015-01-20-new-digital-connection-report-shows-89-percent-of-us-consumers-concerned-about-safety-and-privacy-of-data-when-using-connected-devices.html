<p>Restlet, creators of the most widely deployed framework for creating web APIs, today announced results of a <a href="http://restlet.com/resources/detail/digital-connection-in-the-us-full-survey-results/">survey on how people in the US use connected objects and devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; devices such as thermostats or fitness monitors</a>. While 80 percent of respondents confirm that connected devices improve their quality of life, the vast majority also express grave concerns over the safety and privacy of personal data.</p>
<p>Key findings of the survey:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>51 percent of people feel they need to connect to their applications and services multiple times a day with 11 percent indicating they could not tolerate being disconnected for more than 5 minutes;&nbsp;</li>
<li>52 percent of people use 2 or more devices with close to 20 percent connecting with 4 or more devices;&nbsp;</li>
<li>80 percent of people feel that connected devices and objects actually improve their quality of life;&nbsp;</li>
<li>89 percent of people are concerned about the safety and privacy of their data when using a connected device, of which 30 percent of all respondents indicate they are extremely concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Respondents were also asked about their perception of the accuracy of real-time updates between different types of online and offline interactions with service providers. The vast majority, 83 percent, expressed concerns about the ability of call center agents to access to information already provided online.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;The US population is proving very mature in their relationship to connected objects. Using multiple devices and applications to access services and information, they express a need to be connected frequently and do not hesitate to use the device that is the best fit for their purpose,&rdquo; said Jerome Louvel, chief geek and founder of Restlet. &ldquo;This need for connectivity requires a secure and reliable infrastructure that addresses the main concerns indicated by respondents of our survey: safety and privacy of data, and efficient synchronicity of information through all channels. Web APIs provide a robust foundation for building systems that guarantee instant access to all systems and applications.&rdquo;</em></p>
