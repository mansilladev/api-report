<p><a href="https://shapeshift.io">ShapeShift.io</a>, an instant digital currency exchange service, has partnered with Vaultoro, a platform that allows physical gold to be traded with Bitcoin, through their integration of the ShapeShift API. Vaultoro&rsquo;s integration of the ShapeShift API allows users to trade gold with various cryptocurrencies such as NXT, Dogecoin, Monero, Dash, Namecoin and several dozen others.</p>
<p>"Cryptocurrency, like gold and silver, is real money because its value comes from the market, not from government diktat,&rdquo; said Erik Voorhees, ShapeShift CEO and Founder, &ldquo;With this integration, it's now easier for people all over the world to trade between these forms of real money, and avoid fiat currencies entirely."</p>
<p>Vaultoro&rsquo;s integration of the API is one of many partnerships ShapeShift.io is securing. The company continues to work with partners who desire to expand their customer base by accepting digital currency payment options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were wanting to offer multiple altcoin payment options to customers and ShapeShift.io was the perfect answer. Their API is elegant and was so simple to incorporate into our platform,&rdquo; said Joshua Scigala, Co-founder of Vaultoro.com, &ldquo;ShapeShift makes it seamless for someone to send us say, dogecoin or litecoin, and it gets instantly converted to bitcoin and sent to the user&rsquo;s Vaultoro account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside of their API offering, ShapeShift offers a intuitive, user-friendly website exchange for direct consumer usage, where they can trade Bitcoin for other leading cryptocurrencies.
