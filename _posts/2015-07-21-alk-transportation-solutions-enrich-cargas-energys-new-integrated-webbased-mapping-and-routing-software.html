<p><a href="http://www.alk.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://api.report/images/kinlane/alk-maps-logo.png" alt="" width="250" height="58" align="right" /></a><a href="http://www.alk.com/">ALK Technologies</a>, a Trimble Company and global leader in GeoLogistics&reg; solutions and navigation software, today announced that Cargas Systems, a software and consulting company specializing in cloud accounting, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management software and custom application development, has integrated ALK&rsquo;s comprehensive suite of transportation solutions with Cargas&rsquo; Energy software. The integrated solution provides industry-specific route dispatch, navigation and map visualization for fuel delivery and HVAC service companies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In order to provide a long-term solution that specialized in routing and navigation capabilities which incorporated hazardous materials restrictions for its Route Builder and Real-Time Mobile applications, Cargas integrated:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>ALK&reg; Maps with PC*MILER&reg; Web Services for high-quality map and route visualization with industry-specific commercial routing and restrictions;</li>
<li>CoPilot&reg; TruckTM for safe, accurate, load-specific navigation; and</li>
<li>RouteSync&reg; for sending planned routes in the back office directly to CoPilot Truck in the vehicle for route compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;For years, we sought an integrated solution for cohesive, web-based routing and mapping tools,&rdquo; said Saul Cohen, product specialist for Cargas Systems. &ldquo;Using MapPoint and Bing Maps separately for those functions did not allow for communication or collaboration between the products. We looked at a number of different products over time but it was obvious that ALK Maps was the best company and solution fit. We are very familiar with developing web applications and leveraging the Java Script API allowed us to rewrite our mapping and routing software within a few months and make it immediately available as Service Pack updates to all our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A dynamic route and asset visualization platform, ALK Maps is the foundation on which Cargas&rsquo; delivery routing solution, Route Builder, was developed. The integration allows customers access to industry-specific commercial and hazardous materials routing vital to their business needs, as well as real-time traffic data for enhanced planning. As a web-based platform, ALK Maps allows users to build routes directly within the Cargas software instead of exporting planned routes to a second, locally installed application. Additionally, Cargas&rsquo; customized integration includes the ability to re-route stops using drag-and-drop functionality, view delivery and stop information directly on the map and create optimized routes by simply plotting stops.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition, ALK Maps provides the map visualization for real-time vehicle and asset tracking, such as viewing driver locations, inventory status and delivery progress. Instant modifications to a route plan due to delays or a newly added stop can be accommodated with ease. A demonstration of the newly developed Route Builder can be viewed at: <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2Nhcmdhc2VuZXJneS5jb20vcm91dGUtYnVpbGRlci8=">http://cargasenergy.com/route-builder/</a>.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;With the streamlined approach and functionality of Route Builder, we anticipate time savings of two hours per day in productivity gains for our drivers. Instead of manually sifting through tickets and optimizing their own routes, our drivers are doing what they do best: delivering product,&rdquo; said Steve Fetter, operations manager at Sheller Oil, a Cargas Energy customer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, Cargas&rsquo; Real-Time Mobile applications will now feature CoPilot Truck, providing drivers and technicians truck-specific, turn-by-turn navigation based on their vehicle&rsquo;s dimensions and load. Drivers no longer have to follow a list of static directions. With CoPilot Truck, they have reliable navigation with clear voice-guidance and fast, automatic re-route calculation if a driver misses a turn or goes off route.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To further enhance operational productivity, Cargas also integrated its software and mobile applications with ALK&rsquo;s RouteSync capability. This allows pre-planned or modified routes from ALK Maps to be sent directly to the driver&rsquo;s mobile device running CoPilot Truck. Creating true route compliance, this crucial link not only delivers operational consistency between navigation and dispatch, but also reduces non-revenue mileage by minimizing the variance between actual and planned routes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Leveraging the same source of commercial data that exists in both ALK Maps and CoPilot Truck is essential when producing applications that streamline business operations and efficiencies,&rdquo; said Dan Popkin, senior vice president, enterprise solutions, ALK Technologies.  &ldquo;Our suite of solutions provides the consistency between planned and driven routes that is vital to business success.&rdquo;</p>
