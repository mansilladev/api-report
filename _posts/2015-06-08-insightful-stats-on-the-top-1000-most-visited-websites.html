<p><a href="https://whoapi.com/">WhoAPI Inc.</a> conducted a research that consisted of 1,000 most visited websites on the Internet. With their API they were able to get parsed whois information, (date of domain registration, date of expiry), Google PageRank, SSL presence and host of other information. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of what we thought were the most interesting findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe.com and cisco.com were just a few days from expiring, waiting the last possible moment to renew their domains for another year</li>
<li>There were some really old (30 year), and institutional domains that were still at the top of their game (mit.edu, Harvard.edu), and also old and wining (att.com, ibm.com, apple.com, intel.com, hp.com, cisco.com, )</li>
<li>On the other hand, some domains were barely 1 year old,  and often they were dealing with disputable content</li>
<li>A high percentage (31%) of domains were registered with a brand protection agency, not a typical domain registrar (like Godaddy or Network Solutions, or eNom)</li>
<li>There was a lot of information that we were expecting, like the fact 64% of the most visited domains are .com domains, and that most of 1000 researched websites were hosted in the USA. (53%)</li>
</ul>
