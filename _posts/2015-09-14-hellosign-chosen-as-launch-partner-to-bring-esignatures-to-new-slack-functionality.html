<p><a href="http://www.hellosign.com/slack">HelloSign, the easiest way to electronically sign legally binding documents, announces today a launch partnership with Slack</a>, the essential team communication platform. The partnership adds HelloSign eSignature activity directly into any designated Slack channel, providing teams with more visibility into the status of documents out for signature.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To learn more about our partnership with Slack, click here: http://www.hellosign.com/slack</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This integration allows Slack users to be automatically notified regarding the status of any document sent to a contact through HelloSign, directly within a designated channel in Slack. Once the Slack integration is activated within HelloSign, users can determine which Slack channel the HelloSign notification will appear in. HelloSign notifications regarding status of documents can be sent to any Slack channel, public or private, and any team member in that channel is also able to view the automated notifications. The integration automatically notifies Slack users when a document out for eSignature has been signed in addition to a daily notification listing documents that remain out for eSignature.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Slack is transforming the way teams communicate through an amazing user interface and powerful integrations that provide deep value to their users so we&rsquo;re honored to become partners,&rdquo; said Joseph Walla, CEO and Co-founder of HelloSign. &ldquo;Our aim with this partnership is to extend the benefits of HelloSign to Slack users in a way that makes work more meaningful. We&rsquo;ve made it possible for any Slack user to benefit from the power and utility of eSignatures for free.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Instant updates on the status of HelloSign documents provide Slack users with actionable information where they need it most. Since Slack users are immediately notified once a document is signed, team members can take the appropriate next-step. The integration also allows Slack users to effortlessly track documents with an automated daily summary of documents that are still out for eSignature. Having this information available within any Slack channel aids in team transparency and efficiency while eliminating the hassle of having to leave Slack in order to check the status of important documents sent through HelloSign.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Electronically signing with HelloSign eliminates the inconvenience of printing, scanning, faxing and snail-mailing valuable documents. Businesses that use HelloSign also benefit from a faster turnaround time with contracts, reduction in signage errors and an increase in revenue.
