<p><a href="http://www.systap.com/">SYSTAP</a> is very pleased to launch its new graph database platform&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blazegraph.com/">Blazegraph</a>&trade; with the software release available now on Sourceforge. It is built on the same open source GPLv2 platform and maintains 100% binary and API compatibility with Bigdata&reg;. Blazegraph&trade; will take over as SYSTAP&rsquo;s flagship graph database. It is specifically designed to support big graphs offering both Semantic Web (RDF/SPARQL) and Graph Database (tinkerpop, blueprints, vertex-centric) APIs. It features robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, enterprise-class storage and query and high-availability with online backup, failover and self-healing. It is in production use with enterprises such as Autodesk, EMC, Yahoo7!, and many others. Blazegraph&trade; provides both embedded and standalone modes of operation.</p>
<p>SYSTAP will be fully integrating the Blazegraph&trade; brand over the course of 2015 and all of the existing wiki, blog, and other related pages will be updated. This year will also bring a number of exciting new features in Blazegraph&trade; including improved deployment support, SaaS offerings, support for user-based security models, query optimization, and scalability enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT SYSTAP<br /></strong>SYSTAP was founded with the vision of building highly scalable software solutions for big graphs. Graph problems have very different computational workloads and scaling requirements than conventional big data challenges. Our software and GPU solutions help customers get right the architecture, the software, and the hardware to achieve scaling and high throughput for graph traversal and graph mining. SYSTAP's Blazegraph&trade; graph database platform powers many high profile enterprise applications across domains such as publishing, finance, pharmaceuticals, and bioinformatics. SYSTAP's MapGraph&trade; Accelerator and MapGraph&trade; HPC is a new and disruptive technology for organizations that need to process large graphs in near-real time using GPU technology. SYSTAP has demonstrated MapGraph&trade; achieving performance 10,000X faster than other CPU-based technologies on data-parallel graph analytics.</p>
