<p>Today Digium is pleased to announce the official launch of Respoke, a cloud platform for adding secure communications to web and mobile applications. Respoke provides a rich API that allows developers to easily add live voice, video, messaging, and data as application features. Product managers that want to introduce real-time interactions within a web or mobile app can now point their developers at the Respoke API to see their vision turned into reality in days instead of weeks or months.</p>
<p>Respoke began as a&nbsp;<a title="The Story of Respoke, a virtual startup" href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/111856782882/respoke-a-virtual-startup" target="_blank">virtual startup within Digium</a>&nbsp;and is staffed with a mix of communications industry veterans and cloud computing experts, all working toward providing a unique experience for the next generation of communications developers.</p>
<p><strong>Compelling Business Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Developers have shared they are using Respoke because it&nbsp;<a title="Click to Tweet " href="http://ctt.ec/3c_3p" target="_blank">allows their customers to use an ordinary web browser to do extraordinary things.</a>&nbsp;This includes the ability to easily add individual and group chat messaging, voice and/or video calling, screen sharing, and file sharing to web applications, all without the need to install a cumbersome plug-in. Developers interface with Respoke using an intuitive JavaScript library, RESTful APIs, and soon, mobile SDKs. A robust, scalable cloud infrastructure handles all of the complex back-end aspects of making real-time communications work.</p>
<p>This functionality has enabled customers to grow revenue and improve customer satisfaction. SmarterServices is an educational software company that has been able to add remote audio, video, and screen sharing to its web app in a matter of days to offer a more robust set of online proctoring services. Averbuch Realty is excited about Respoke because it enables web customers to call an agent&rsquo;s mobile phone directly using our new outbound calling feature. &nbsp;Simple integrations like this allow businesses to give their clients a world-class web customer service experience, rich with context, full of satisfaction, and void of frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Respoke: Today and Tomorrow</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Respoke has always been about listening to customer feedback and using it to drive the functionality and features of the service. The Respoke team has been hard at work putting that feedback into action.</p>
<p>Here are some recent improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Released inbound calling and outbound calling functionality</li>
<li>Added sample apps and developer tools to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/respoke">its Github page</a></li>
<li>Introduced&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/110068512708/introducing-respoke-screen-sharing">screen sharing</a>&nbsp;capabilities</li>
<li>Improved its&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.respoke.io/">documentation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://community.respoke.io/">community site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.report/2015/02/16/web-communication-platform-respoke-updates-pricing/">Updated its pricing tiers</a>&nbsp;to make things easier for customers</li>
<li>Launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.respoke.io/">redesigned homepage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.respoke.io/#/signup">user sign-up flow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Several features aimed at increasing market penetration and compatibility are slated for beta release within the next quarter. &nbsp;These include Android and iOS mobile SDKs, which will enable mobile developers to easily add messaging, voice, and video to their mobile apps, providing a great differentiator for those in that market segment. In addition, current limitations using Respoke with the Internet Explorer and Safari browsers will be eliminated within the next quarter with the release of a plugin for these legacy browsers.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Danny Windham, Digium&rsquo;s CEO, made a&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.digium.com/2014/09/24/call-early-adopters-respoke-web-communications/">call for early adopters for Respoke</a>. As Danny explained in his blog post, Respoke was created as a &ldquo;new web communications platform built for web and mobile developers&rdquo; that, along with Asterisk, would foster &ldquo;the next generation of communications experiences.&rdquo; With this official launch of the Respoke service we now invite the broader web and mobile developer communities to start creating those next great communications experiences.</p>
