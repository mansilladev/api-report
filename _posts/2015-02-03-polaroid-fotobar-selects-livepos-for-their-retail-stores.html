<p>Like so many of <a href="http://www.livepos.com/Links/Index.aspx">LivePOS&rsquo;s</a> happy customers, George and the people at Polaroid Fotobar had very specific ideas about what they wanted their point of sale software to do. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they couldn&rsquo;t find a software company that was willing to turn their dreams into reality.<br /><br />George Garcia, Chief Information Officer for Polaroid Fotobar, explains; &ldquo;LivePOS customized their system to allow us to take transactions from our proprietary system and import them into their point of sale software in real-time. &nbsp;Any LivePOS user can now utilize that function, but that work was done specifically for us.&rdquo;<br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;There were several things we were looking for in a point of sale system. On the technical side, I wanted something that had a good open API so I could integrate it with both our back end and front end systems. &nbsp;The API was the main thing on my end. We also wanted to make sure our POS had good loss prevention features and was something that had an easy to use interface.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Their API is very robust. You can see that a lot of work and planning went into creating it. With LivePOS I can create a complete, enterprise grade solution for Polaroid Fotobar.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Initially, we were running another POS at a few stores, but they didn't provide us with the customizations and integrations that we needed, that's why we moved to Live. LivePOS is also simpler than other packages we looked at, which saves on training costs.&rdquo;<br /><br />George spent over 6 months researching point of sale software packages before choosing LivePOS. &nbsp;He appreciated the simplicity of LivePOS on his first pass through and the extensive video library answered most of the questions he had about what the software package was capable of doing before he ever contacted the company directly.<br /><br />&ldquo;They have more material out there than any vendor that I saw while I was researching point of sale systems. It&rsquo;s great! &nbsp;It saves a lot of time when you can go through the videos and see what the user interface looks like and what you can and can't do rather than having to ask a lot of questions or doing a demo over the phone. &nbsp;It's very useful.&rdquo;<br /><br />We&rsquo;re doing integrations on the back end first. &nbsp;When a transaction&rsquo;s completed in LivePOS, we can have the API grab that data from every store and import it into our back end system.That gives us real time inventory, reporting and so forth for multiple locations. &nbsp;Having every single transaction come into that system within a few seconds is very advantageous to us.&rdquo;<br /><br />The folks at Polaroid Fotobar chose LivePOS after a long and exhaustive search for software that started last year. &nbsp;When asked if they would recommend LivePOS to a friend, George gave the package hearty thumbs up.<br /><br />&ldquo;LivePOS has a very intuitive interface, good loss prevention features, it&rsquo;s easy to implement and the support is great. We wanted to make sure we could get somebody on the phone, not just via email, but rather on a 24/7 basis. &nbsp;That, plus the fact that they were so accommodating in doing the custom work we required sealed the deal. We talked to a number of vendors about our customizations and it was either going to very costly or they simply wouldn't do it. I definitely would recommend LivePOS to Franchisor looking for an affordable, feature-rich, easy to use POS system that takes advantage of the Cloud and is backed by great people.</p>
