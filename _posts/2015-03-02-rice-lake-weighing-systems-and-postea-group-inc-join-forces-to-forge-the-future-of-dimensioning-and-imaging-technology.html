An added high-resolution camera captures an image of the parcel to identify bar codes and OCR data. Its free API allows users to interface with the system to retrieve dimensions, weight, a low-resolution image and more valuable data using a simple HTTP request and XML parsing method. iDimension is easily installed over existing conveyors and workstations, streamlining operations and optimizing efficiency and quality.
