<p>Maestro PMS provides its guest text message module in partnership with Swift SMS Gateway&reg; Inc., a global provider of mobile text messaging services since 2007.</p>
<p>Warren Dehan, President of Maestro PMS, said, &ldquo;With more guests relying on their mobile devices, Maestro launched proactive SMS communications to serve guests on property. We partnered with Swift SMS Gateway to provide the platform to allow Maestro PMS to communicate directly with cell phone networks. Swift SMS Gateway supports international phone protocols which enables Maestro operators to reach their global visitors regardless of their phone carrier.</p>
<p>The Maestro SMS text solution is a flexible guest engagement tool. &ldquo;Our SMS platform lets independents proactively update individual guests directly from Maestro PMS when their room is ready to check-in,&rdquo; Dehan said. &ldquo;More than that, it can instantly reach all guests if there is an emergency, or specific guest segments, such as members of a group, to notify them if their meeting room has changed. The new solution is ideal for busy independent operators who want to establish a closer guest relationship with more personalized service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swift SMS Gateway is delighted to partner with Maestro PMS to integrate our SMS into its widely installed Property Management Suite,&rdquo; said Brian J. Johnson, President, Swift SMS Gateway Inc. &ldquo;Our system provides a simple seamless integration of text messaging into Maestro&rsquo;s front desk Guest Messaging and its back of house systems."</p>
