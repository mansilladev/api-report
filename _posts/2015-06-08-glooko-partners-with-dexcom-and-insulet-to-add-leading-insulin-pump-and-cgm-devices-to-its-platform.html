<p><a href="http://www.glooko.com">Glooko Inc.</a> today announced partnerships with <a href="http://dexcom.com/">Dexcom, Inc.</a>, developer and marketer of a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, and with Insulet Corporation, the leader in tubeless insulin pump technology with its OmniPod&reg; Insulin Management System. These partnerships are another step in Glooko&rsquo;s efforts to unify all diabetes relevant device data into a single, unified platform to enable both patients and healthcare providers to improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Digital health data integration will have a significant impact on the clinical care we provide for people with diabetes,&rdquo; said Dr. Howard Wolpert of the Joslin Diabetes Center. &rdquo;Our work with Glooko in creating the Joslin HypoMap powered by Glooko and Glooko continuing to add in device data and reports that synthesize information to provide clinically significant insights not present on currently-available data downloads will help more patients to realize the benefits of CGM and pump therapy, and will help clinicians provide more efficient and effective care,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>Glooko will deliver its next generation product that includes both Dexcom CGM and Insulet&rsquo;s OmniPod pump data this summer, adding data from both systems into it&rsquo;s unified platform that already syncs data from more than 30 blood glucose (BG) monitors (over 90% market share) and the most popular fitness and biometric tools with patient&rsquo;s Apple or Android mobile devices. Patients can also record food intake and medication and insulin dosage to provide context around changes in their blood glucose readings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to be partnering with Glooko to add Dexcom CGM data to their comprehensive diabetes management platform, said Kevin Sayer, CEO of Dexcom. &ldquo;We believe that Glooko&rsquo;s platform which accesses Dexcom data through our &ldquo;open architecture&rdquo; can be a very meaningful tool for our patients to manage their diabetes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dexcom&rsquo;s CGM data and Insulet&rsquo;s OmniPod&rsquo;s pump data will be brought into Glooko and structured for patients and their healthcare providers in a simple to interpret view in both the Glooko mobile app and in a risk-stratified view via Glooko&rsquo;s Population Tracker&trade;. Glooko will access data from these devices directly, in addition to pulling data from the Apple Healthkit. Glooko enables healthcare providers to engage at-risk patients before costly intervention and hospitalizations occur. In addition, Glooko allows healthcare providers and patients to understand and analyze their diabetes data, and set reminders for improved treatment plan adherence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now OmniPod patients will have the ability to view their insulin delivery, blood glucose and CGM data together,&rdquo; said Patrick Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Insulet Corporation. &ldquo;Patients will have access to data that will allow them to take full advantage of the clinical benefits that the OmniPod system provides while still providing the freedom of the unique, tubeless insulin delivery system. This collaboration furthers our shared vision of helping to make life with diabetes easier by providing greater access to the data people living with diabetes need to make smart and effective decisions to realize better control."</p>
<p>This announcement comes on the heels of Glooko&rsquo;s <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9va28uY29tL3ByZXNz">recent Series B investment</a> that brought $16.5M of additional funds into the business. The investment will be used to fuel expansion of Glooko&rsquo;s FDA-cleared, HIPAA-compliant platform to include device data from insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems and integration of personalized predictive algorithms.</p>
<p>Glooko is demonstrating its integration with both the Dexcom CGM and the Insulet OmniPod Insulin Management System in booth #104 at the American Diabetes Association&rsquo;s Annual Scientific Conference from June 5-9 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston, MA.
