<p><a href="http://www.giftcards.com">GiftCards.com</a>, the largest and most trafficked online retailer of gift cards, today launched a new rewards program called &ldquo;G-Money Rewards.&rdquo; Starting today, GiftCards.com customers can earn G-Money Rewards points on every single purchase to redeem against future purchases, and in the near future discounts on gas at thousands of locations across the USA from one of the leading providers. Customers can earn and redeem points across platforms at GiftCards.com and via its website and mobile apps available in the iTunes and Google Play stores.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">G-Money Rewards launches with a simple concept -- earn points and use them for discounts in future purchases as well as discounts on gas. Consumers earn a point per every $1.00 spent and every point earned represents $0.01 in future spending power. There are no membership dues or costs associated with joining G-Money Rewards program. Consumers are given rewards for brand loyalty, with no extra strings attached. To enroll in G-Money Rewards and for complete details about the program, visit http://www.giftcards.com/rewards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Reward platform is API-driven and part of GiftCards.com&rsquo;s suite of marketing solutions for corporate clients.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By the end of the summer, GiftCards.com plans to enhance the program further. For example, consumers will be able to redeem points for gas at all participating gas stations nationwide or choose a charity to donate the points. Other future additions include the ability for customers to gain points for other actions like providing valuable referrals to the site, and the brand&rsquo;s ability to push promotions via flexible points -- for example any Black Friday purchase could have double points.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We looked at what succeeded in the offline gift card world and we saw that rewarding consumers with discounts, and specifically gas discounts, for buying gift cards from grocery stores was a huge success over the past 10 years, and we improved the model&rdquo; said Jason Wolfe, CEO and Founder of GiftCards.com. &ldquo;Our rewards program delivers choice and convenience -- you don&rsquo;t have to drive anywhere to get your gift cards unlike grocery stores, and our gas points are redeemable at thousands of gas station nationwide and not limited to your local gas stations.&rdquo;</p>
