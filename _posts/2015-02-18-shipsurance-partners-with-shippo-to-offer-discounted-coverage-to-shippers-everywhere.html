<p><a href="http://www.shipsurance.com/">Shipsurance</a> and <a href="https://goshippo.com/">Shippo</a> have partnered to offer discounted shipping insurance coverage to all users of the Shippo platform. Shippo customers have full, integrated access to insure their parcels for loss and damage while in transit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shippo offers a unique product as an API based shipping solution,&rdquo; said Ariel Shmorak, Vice President of Operations for Shipsurance. &ldquo;Our shipping insurance coverage fits in perfectly with their automated, transactional based method of printing shipping labels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through this partnership, all Shippo users can cover their packages for loss, damage, or shortage while in transit directly through the Shippo API system. They benefit with lower rates and faster claims processing. If something is lost or damaged in transit, most claims are paid within five days, rather than waiting months from the carriers. All Shippo users are assigned a dedicated Shipsurance representative to help them through the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shipping is notoriously a pain-point of small businesses. Shipsurance has been a strong partner for Shippo in that they&rsquo;ve helped our customers ship with ease of mind,&rdquo; said Nima Elyassi-Rad, Vice President of Business Development for Shippo.</p>
