<p><a href="http://www.avature.net">Joberate</a>, a technology platform that is the world&rsquo;s first and only global people directory for job seeking behaviors that monitors and measures job seeking activities of the global workforce by accessing publicly available Social Data, and Avature, a leading provider of innovative Web 2.0 talent acquisition solutions delivered as SaaS, announce that an API integration between the two technology platforms has been established.</p>
<p>Avature clients can now gain a competitive advantage in recruitment of top talent by subscribing to <a title="Joberate platform of job seeking behavior analytics and information" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2JlcmF0ZS5jb20vdXNlLWNhc2VzLw==">J</a>oberate&rsquo;s global people directory delivered within Avature&rsquo;s native environment and configured workflows, and immediately gain access to real-time job seeking behaviors of potential candidates, including Joberate&rsquo;s unique job seeking behavior metric called J-Score&trade;.</p>
<p>The speed with which people decide to change their jobs represents a tremendous opportunity for Talent Acquisition and Recruiting departments that are charged with recruiting top talent, with time to hire, quality of hire, and cost per hire being their key performance metrics. Receiving a notification via the Avature platform when a person&rsquo;s J-Score increases enables recruiters to immediately contact a prospect with a potential job offer, which gives recruiters a competitive advantage for top talent, and helps them improve all of their key performance metrics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our mission is to provide job seeking behavior information and analytics for more than 1.8 billion people over the next three years, which represents nearly half of the world&rsquo;s employable population,&rdquo; said Michael Beygelman, Joberate CEO.  He continued, &ldquo;Our technology demonstrates the power and the capability of leveraging Social &ldquo;Big&rdquo; Data and machine learning, to provide real-time insights about observable job seeking behaviors of the global workforce to help companies hire top talent quickly and cost-effectively.&rdquo;</p>
