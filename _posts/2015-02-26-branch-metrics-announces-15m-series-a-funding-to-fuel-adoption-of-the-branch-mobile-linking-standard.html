<p><a href="https://branch.io/">Branch Metrics</a>, a mobile software company focused on mobile linking, announced today that it has finalized&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$15 million</span>&nbsp;in Series A financing co-led by leading venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Ben Narasin, with participation from Pejman Mar Ventures,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Zach Coelius</span>, Cowboy Ventures and TriplePoint Capital. This funding arrives on the heels of the Series Seed financing of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2.75 million</span>&nbsp;that was finalized in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 2014</span>. The new funding will be used for market expansion of Branch's mobile linking platform.</p>
<p>Branch links have popularized what is commonly referred to as "mobile deep linking," where pages inside of mobile apps are accessible immediately with the click of a link. Previously, these types of links would only work if the app was currently installed on the mobile device. Branch's technology allows the links to function regardless of app installation. Once developers adopt Branch links, pages within the app &ndash; news articles, photos, messages, product pages, and more &ndash; are finally just a click away. Branch links also enable companies to track sharing activity, create smart referral systems, and generate invaluable insight for marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>"Four years ago, just 3% of Internet use was through a mobile device &ndash; today the total is nearly 40%. As native application use is the preferred mobile experience, Branch links make the native app transitions much smoother for the end user and more like the familiar experience of web page transitions," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Alex Austin</span>, CEO and co-founder of Branch. "At the rate developers are adopting Branch links, it's very likely that by the end of 2015, every person with a smartphone will have benefited from our technology."</p>
<p>Since the service was announced five months ago, there have been more than 20 million links to pages inside apps created across Branch's network of app developers. The total number of links is expected to grow to greater than 100 million within the next three months.</p>
<p>"The substantial customer interest and subsequent platform growth have been remarkable," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Scott Sandell</span>, general partner at NEA. "Alex and his team have demonstrated the dynamic ability to accomplish in weeks what would take some companies months. Branch is providing a critical solution for any organization with a mobile presence &ndash; I am thrilled to be a part of their journey to revolutionize the mobile app ecosystem."</p>
<p>The service was immediately adopted by some of the top product teams in mobile, including HotelTonight, iHeartRadio, Instacart, Coffee Meets Bagel and nearly a thousand more. Coffee Meets Bagel has leveraged Branch's linking technology to convert web traffic to mobile in addition to powering their profile links. "After discovering Branch Metrics, we quickly replaced all of our deep links with Branch links to take advantage of their superior accuracy and ease of use across our three platforms (web, iOS, and Android). Branch Metrics gives unparalleled insights and functionality compared with anything we could have built in-house," said Adam&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/114952776754275354728?prsrc=4" target="_blank">Berlinsky-Schine</a>, Chief Technology Officer for Coffee Meets Bagel.</p>
<p>The Branch linking and analytics SDK are available for immediate use at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://branch.io/" target="_blank">https://branch.io</a>; The service can be used via the iOS, Android or Web SDK as well as Branch dashboard and Public API. The core linking and analytics service are free to use.</p>
