<p><a href="http://www.amercanex.com">Amercanex</a>, the American Cannabis Exchange (ACE), today announced an agreement with Blue Line Protection Group (BLPG.OB) for Blue Line to provide transportation services for Amercanex Transacting Members. Amercanex is the first fully electronic cannabis marketplace in which cultivators, wholesale distributors and retail vendors can buy and sell their inventories in a fully transparent intra-state market.</p>
<p>The Amercanex and Blue Line Protection Group partnership marks a first in the Cannabis Industry, linking transportation services electronically via a fixed API (Application Program Interface) into a fully electronic transparent online marketplace.  This convenient new electronic solution will enable Amercanex Transacting Members to instantly calculate their delivery costs using Blue Line&rsquo;s armored delivery services to transport product purchased on the ACE market place between properly licensed participants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to have Blue Line join forces with Amercanex as they are one of the most successful armored transportation services in the country focused on the cannabis industry. As competition enters the market, dispensary owners, edible companies and cultivators will look to electronic platforms to continuously build their brand and grow their business while lowering costs. We believe working with who Rolling Stone Magazine recently dubbed &lsquo;the Guardians of the Greenery&rsquo;, Blue Line Protection Group will provide added assurance of our commitment to our Transacting Members to deliver superior services and security of products transported via the ACE Marketplace,&rdquo; said Steve Janjic, CEO of Amercanex.</p>
<p>Blue Line Protection Group clients upon becoming Amercanex Transacting Members will now receive all the featured benefits that Amercanex has to offer. The ECM model (Electronic Cannabis Market) will provide clients with full market transparency and greater control of the buy/sell process, enabling better pricing, full regulatory reporting and ultimately lowering costs. This opportunity provides ACE Members with an online platform to leverage internet-based technologies, allowing their businesses to react quicker to market opportunities. Implementation of transportation services including the ability to calculate and deduct transport costs as a function of the overall transaction within the ACE Marketplace will assist both Amercanex and Blue Line in strengthening relationships with their customers and partners; improve productivity; and reduce overall costs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This strategic alliance agreement between Blue Line and Amercanex further solidifies our commitment to bringing our suite of protection and compliance services to the expanding online marketplace,&rdquo; said Sean Campbell, Blue Line&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;Amercanex clients will benefit from Blue Line&rsquo;s commitment to offering traceable, secure transportation of their products while remaining in full compliance with all local and state regulations.&rdquo;</p>
