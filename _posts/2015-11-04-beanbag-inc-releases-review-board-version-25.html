<p><a href="http://www.beanbaginc.com">Beanbag, Inc.</a>, the company behind Review Board, announces the immediate availability of version 2.5 of their leading code review solution. Already a hugely popular tool with hundreds of thousands of users worldwide, version 2.5 extends Review Board&rsquo;s leadership as a flexible and fast code review solution. Because it works with every major repository and bug tracker, has a full-featured API and rich extensibility framework, and supports both hosted and local deployment options, Review Board is perfect for medium to large enterprises, teams with custom workflows and developers of mission-critical software.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;With 2.5, we pushed to improve the tool&rsquo;s extensibility, giving customers even more ways to make Review Board a frictionless part of their workflow, and at the same time deliver major productivity improvements,&rdquo; said Beanbag CEO Christian Hammond. &ldquo;As a customer-driven company, we incorporated feedback from our users around things like mobile support, improved collaboration capabilities and UX improvements.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;As both a heavy Review Board user and a contributor, I&rsquo;m very excited about release 2.5,&rdquo; said Stephen Gallagher of the Fedora Project. &ldquo;The Beanbag team and entire Review Board upstream open source project exemplify all the ideals of the open source movement: agility, collaboration and community. The interface improvements in 2.5 really make Review Board feel like a tool for today&rsquo;s developer. And as I&rsquo;m increasingly away from my desk, mobile support to keep up with reviews on the go is critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Griffin Myers, a developer with a leading maker of high performance signal processing applications, added "Review Board is an indispensable part of our development process. It helps increase collaboration within our team, improves code quality, and provides a pathway for new team members to become assimilated with a large existing code base. The Beanbag team has cultivated an active user community and is incredibly responsive to, and receptive of, user feedback. I&rsquo;m most excited about 2.5&rsquo;s restyled UI, improved mobile support, and expandable diff fragments. We also love the enhancements to Markdown rendering, e-mail and dashboard management, all of which have their roots in user requests."</p>
