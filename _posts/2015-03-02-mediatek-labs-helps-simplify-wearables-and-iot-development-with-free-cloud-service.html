<p><a href="http://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/home/p_home.gsp">MediaTek Labs,</a> today announced general availability of its new Cloud Sandbox data platform to better help developers bring their ideas to life for the Internet of Things (IoT). The new service, which is free to all registered MediaTek Labs members globally, offers convenient storage of and access to data from wearable and IoT devices during prototyping.</p>
<p>"MediaTek recognizes the importance of a cloud-based IoT platform and playground to service developers and makers who are prototyping wearable or IoT devices," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Marc Naddell</span>, VP of MediaTek Labs. "With this complimentary offering from MediaTek Labs, IoT developers no longer need to set up and manage their own web server or source third-party cloud platform services. Instead they can focus on their IoT device prototyping and value proposition, accelerating the time from solution ideation to prototype and proof-of-concept."</p>
<p>A considerable challenge for developers in the early stages of device creation is not only the management of large amounts of data but also a convenient and simple way to visualize the data and demo prototypes to collaborators. MediaTek Cloud Sandbox helps solve this with a variety of invaluable features , including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Data storage and visual charting</li>
<li>Data monitoring with notifications</li>
<li>Device remote control</li>
<li>Firmware upgrades over-the-air (FOTA)</li>
<li>RESTful API support, TCP socket connection</li>
<li>Web or mobile app based access</li>
</ul>
<p>MediaTek Cloud Sandbox (MCS) will be on display in MediaTek's booth at Mobile World Congress - Hall 6, Stand 6E21 - with three compelling demonstrations, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wine Brewer &ndash; A MediaTek LinkIt&trade; ONE development board implementation that won first prize in ITRI Mobilehero 2014 competition in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Taiwan</span>.</li>
<li>Weather Station &ndash; A LinkIt ONE development board implementation that gathers and pushes real-time temperature, humidity and pressure data to MCS, and is able to have its fan controlled from MCS and the MCS companion mobile app.</li>
<li>MediaTek LinkIt Connect 7681 demo &ndash; A LinkIt Connect 7681 development board implementation and its companion mobile app to demonstrate real-time LED color control.</li>
</ol>
<p>MediaTek Labs was launched in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 2014</span>&nbsp;and continues to provide developers, makers and service providers with SDKs, HDKs and documentation, as well as technical and business support.
