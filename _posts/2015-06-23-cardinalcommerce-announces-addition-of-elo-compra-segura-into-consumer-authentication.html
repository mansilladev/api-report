<p>With <a href="http://www.cardinalcommerce.com">One Connection to Cardina</a>l via the Super API(TM), Cardinal Consumer Authentication (CCA) leverages the benefits of all the brands. CCA allows merchants to authenticate their consumers using Verified by Visa, MasterCard SecureCode, MasterCard SecureCode+, American Express SafeKey, JCB J/Secure, Diners Club ProtectBuy, UnionPay, Maestro and now, ELO Compra Segura.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Cardinal is excited to bring our Consumer Authentication technology to the Brazilian market with our newest partner, ELO. With CCA, merchants and banks will be able to significantly improve their authorization rates, accept more card-not-present transactions with confidence, and provide consumers with a safe, friction-free checkout experience.  We, in real-time, using our collaborative approach, can compare what the banks know about their consumers (KYC) and what the merchants understand about their consumers, to yield the best results,&rdquo; said Cardinal CEO Mike Keresman.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ELO, a Brazilian brand with more than 20 million cards issued and accepted by 1.4 million brick and mortar merchants, is developing their presence in the online channel by securing a 3-D Secure license from EMVCo for eCommerce.

By choosing Cardinal, merchants in the region can deploy CCA and leverage all of the 3DS brands, including ELO CS.</p>
