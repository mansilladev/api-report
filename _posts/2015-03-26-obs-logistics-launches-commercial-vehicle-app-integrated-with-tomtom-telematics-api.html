<p><a href="http://www.obs-logistics.com/">OBS Logistics</a> will announce the launch of its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.obs-logistics.com/vehub-vehicle-app.php">VEhub mobile app&nbsp;for vehicle management</a> at the forthcoming CV Show. VEhub is a low cost, easy to use mobile app that provides an entry level system for fleet management to transport operators of all sizes.</p>
<p>The Android app is available for the TomTom PRO 827x series and extends the use of its photo capture capability and geo location tracking to enable companies running a transport operation to manage everyday processes more efficiently.</p>
<p>Daily vehicle checks in the VOSA / DVSA format allow drivers to capture details of any defects, with photo capture to provide a detailed record to facilitate forward planning for routine maintenance or repairs and to comply with health and safety requirements for road worthiness. Barcode scanning allows the location of each trailer and unit to be captured as required. In the case of accident the app supports the driver with a clear and simple response process including capture of all relevant information electronically.</p>
<p>Giles Margerison, Sales Director at TomTom Telematics comments: &ldquo;OBS Logistics is making optimal use of our .connect partner strategy. They have built an app that our TomTom PRO 827x customers will strongly benefit from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information captured by drivers via the device is aggregated in a simple browser based management portal for print or email of documents, reporting and analysis and geo-location of key assets.</p>
