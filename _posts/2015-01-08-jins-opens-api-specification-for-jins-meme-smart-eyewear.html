<p>(HQ: Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo: Hitoshi Tanaka, President) announced today that it will officially open the API specification for its groundbreaking JINS MEME smart eyewear to the mobile app developer community. In conjunction, JINS is launching the &ldquo;JINS MEME DEVELOPER IDEA PITCH CONTEST&rdquo;, a contest open to people from any industry in the U.S. and Japan to generate creative ideas to expand research and development for applications for &ldquo;JINS MEME&rdquo;, which will be released in autumn 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Opening up JINS MEME Data for Mobile App Developers</strong><br />JINS MEME is the world&rsquo;s first smart sensing eyewear developed under the concept to &ldquo;let you see yourself,&rdquo; using bio-sensing technology to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety, wellness and health. While looking just like fashionable eyewear, JINS MEME has patented three-point electroculography (EOG) and six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope sensors that capture unique biodata (DEEP DATA) such as sleepiness, focus level and body balance, which was not possible with conventional wearable devices.</p>
<p>JINS MEME will make its API (Application Programming Interface) data available on the <a href="http://developers.jins.com">JINS MEME Developers Site</a>.</p>
<p>The API will provide two different modes: real-time and standard modes to support various kinds of applications. The data acquired and sent to smartphones is different depending on which mode you choose, though you can also switch between modes.</p>
<p>The SDK (Software Development Kit) will be available at the end of March 2015.</p>
