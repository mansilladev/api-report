<p>The City of Durham and Durham County governments in North Carolina have chosen OpenDataSoft, an award-winning Paris-based internet platform, to power their growing Open Data initiative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;We are all working on a project that will result in an open data portal which is head and shoulders above what has been done before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deal marks <a href="http://www.opendatasoft.com">OpenDataSoft&rsquo;s</a> first customer in the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We chose OpenDataSoft because it was best suited to help us achieve specific distinctive project objectives,&rdquo; said Greg Marrow, CIO of Durham County. &ldquo;Our vision is to build a highly sustainable open data program that empowers our citizens, employees, private industry while being open to other local, state and federal governments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After sifting through dozens of open data platforms and API architectures available the team, led by recently retained open data consultant, Jason Hare, chose ODS based upon the criteria established by the joint City and the County team.</p>
<p>Kerry Goode, CIO for the City of Durham, said, &ldquo;We specified a platform that was easy to use, worked with almost any device, and integrated well with other open data technologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recommended OpenDataSoft because it is easy to transform and work with data on the platform itself,&rdquo; said Hare. &ldquo;For example, authors can make custom reporting pages on the fly with html5 and css3 thus enhancing creativity and user experience.&rdquo;</p>
