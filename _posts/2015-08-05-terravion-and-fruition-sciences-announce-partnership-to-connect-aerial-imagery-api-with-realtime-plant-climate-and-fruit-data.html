<p><a href="http://www.fruitionsciences.com/en">Fruition's products provide in-depth data as to how specific vines are performing over time</a>. TerrAvion gives growers comprehensive info on how entire fields respond at frequent intervals,&rdquo; Robert Morris, TerrAvion CEO, said.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Although, last year, we passed flat files of our aerial imagery data to Fruition&rsquo;s software, now it&rsquo;s automatic, real-time, and directly to the grower&rsquo;s web application. The API based integration gives growers quick access to TerrAvion&rsquo;s most current data in the Fruition web app.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This combined service aims to be a reference for the industry, allowing growers to efficiently visualize their vegetative growth and maximize their block-to-block management.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Combining TerrAvion&rsquo;s aerial imagery expertise with Fruition&rsquo;s plant physiology expertise, customers can now develop a smarter zoning of their vineyard, enabling them to efficiently address the specific needs of each zone, better plan their harvest dates, improve their yield estimates, and increase their grape quality at harvest.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Fruition Sciences provides the most advanced vineyard monitoring solution in the wine industry, integrating automatically and in real time a comprehensive range of vineyard data, including GIS tools, weather data, plant water use measurements, petiole analysis, and fruit maturation data. Through innovative and expert techniques, Fruition&rsquo;s software allows to visualize, analyze, and compare their data, enabling them to better connect their microclimate with their practices and their harvest result.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The benefits of combining Fruition Sciences with TerrAvion vineyard imagery, is to identify when and where fruit is uniformly ripe and how fruit ripens by analyzing changes observed in the vineyard throughout the season.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;TerrAvion&rsquo;s aerial imagery provides a full view of the state of vine canopy, and a way to make immediate decisions on how to improve that&rdquo; Fruition Sciences founder Thibaut Scholasch, said. &ldquo;By partnering with TerrAvion, we can help growers save water and improve wine quality, by integrating imagery with real-time climate, plant, and fruit data.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The information collected by TerrAvion and Fruition Sciences resides in the cloud, and is accessible anytime, anywhere, from any web-enabled device.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;TerrAvion delivers high-revisit aerial imagery so that wine growers can make the smartest growing decisions every week, but we&rsquo;ve always thought that our customers should dictate where we deliver that imagery to,&rdquo; said Adam Metz, VP at TerrAvion. &ldquo;Many of our customers love Fruition&rsquo;s Sap Flow Sensors as well as its analytical platform, so it was an easy decision to deliver the full TerrAvion image into the Fruition software interface.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This integration of TerrAvion&rsquo;s imagery and Fruition Sciences&rsquo; analytics is available to all Fruition Sciences customers as of June 2015.</p>
