<p><a href="http://www.c4eo.org/">C4EO</a>, an independent research unit of Texas State Technical College, today launched from SXSWedu 2015 the free&nbsp;<a href="http://www.skillsengine.com/">SkillsEngineTM Profile Builder</a>&nbsp;and the SkillsEngine Competency API, two powerful tools for dramatically increasing strategic decision making around employability.</p>
<p>The SkillsEngine service is brought to you by the Center for Employability Outcomes (C4EO) at Texas State Technical College. The Center is a response to the growing demand for skilled talent generated by rising incumbent worker retirements (baby boomers), global competition, and technology advances across industry sectors. C4EO bridges the competency needs of industry with colleges.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5za2lsbHNlbmdpbmUuY29t">SkillsEngine Profile Builder</a>&nbsp;analyzes your unique data and detects occupations, as well as employment data specific to a selected state. In addition, the tool creates custom sets of related work activities from the C4EO curated library of competencies. This information can be used to help individuals write better resumes, educators develop measurable learning outcomes, and HR professionals create more relevant job postings.</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, the new Competency API analyzes input data and returns results as a set of ranked Competency Arrays in formatted JSON. Each array consists of unique data elements designed for use in customer applications. Firms receive access to the SkillsEngine Skills Library via the API for building new applications to bring to market. C4EO has opened the beta partner application process where select partners will be the first to gain access to the Competency API.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SkillsEngine API enables developers to quickly translate text into high quality skills data for any application. That&rsquo;s huge,&rdquo; stated Michael Bettersworth, vice chancellor and chief policy officer at TSTC. &ldquo;Our main focus with the SkillsEngine set of products is to help industry, educators and individuals to make the best decisions around employment possible. We want to fundamentally evolve skills alignment.&rdquo;</p>
