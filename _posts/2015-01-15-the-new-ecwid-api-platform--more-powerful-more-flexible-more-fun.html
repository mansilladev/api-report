<p>Great news for&nbsp;all the&nbsp;developers out there! The brand new Ecwid API Platform has launched, enabling anyone to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;application for&nbsp;Ecwid. With the&nbsp;help of&nbsp;the&nbsp;new Ecwid API,third-party&nbsp;apps get the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;manage all store data, add pages to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ecwid Control panel, customize Ecwid storefronts on&nbsp;the&nbsp;fly, and&nbsp;much more.</p>
<h2>Ecwid and&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;developers</h2>
<p>Ecwid now has more than 600,000&nbsp;registered stores around the&nbsp;world encompassing industries such as&nbsp;apparel, music, automotive, literature, art, photography, and&nbsp;more. Each business is&nbsp;unique, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ecwid API now allows them all to&nbsp;manage their store based on&nbsp;their specific requirements. Different businesses need to, and&nbsp;now can, leverage Ecwid in&nbsp;different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some choose to&nbsp;use Ecwid&rsquo;s default design for&nbsp;their storefront, while others customize the&nbsp;look and&nbsp;feel of&nbsp;their store to&nbsp;better fit their brand.</li>
<li>Some install&nbsp;built-in&nbsp;Ecwid widgets, but others prefer to&nbsp;create custom store elements on&nbsp;their site.</li>
<li>Some track their orders within the&nbsp;Ecwid Control Panel, and&nbsp;others import their orders from Ecwid and&nbsp;manage them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ecwid is&nbsp;powerful and&nbsp;feature-rich,&nbsp;it&nbsp;covers nearly all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small business&rsquo; needs. When there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;need to&nbsp;extend store functionality, the&nbsp;Ecwid API and&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;applications fill the&nbsp;gap. Ecwid has been providing a&nbsp;basic set of&nbsp;APIs for&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time and&nbsp;many Ecwid merchants are currently using them to&nbsp;customize their stores and&nbsp;connect to&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;services and&nbsp;applications. These include email marketing applications, custom payment gateways, affiliate marketing services, synchronization with external CRM systems, and&nbsp;so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>With this update, we&nbsp;launch a&nbsp;<strong>brand new Ecwid API platform</strong>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;much more powerful and&nbsp;provides great opportunities for&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;application developers.</p>
