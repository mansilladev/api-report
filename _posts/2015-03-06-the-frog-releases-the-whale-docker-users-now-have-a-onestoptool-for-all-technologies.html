<p>The new version of Bintray allows organizations to create an unlimited number of private Docker repositories, and through the use of fast Akamai content delivery networks (CDNs), it decreases the download time of large Docker repositories, speeding DevOps work significantly. Bintray&rsquo;s highly available service and download layer also helps Docker users eliminate service disruption and performance degradation issues.</p>
<p>In summary, the Docker community now has an alternative that enables:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Unlimited private repository support</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Customers to use their own host names for Docker registries</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">CDN service for faster, more efficient downloads</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Logs and statistics for private and public repositories</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Smart image cleanup that accounts for ancestry trees</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">A single tool to serve as a secured local Docker registry alongside other technologies (Debian, RPM, Maven, Gradle, Nuget, and more)</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Docker support is a natural progression of JFrog's mission to provide agnostic, enterprise-grade support for every stage and aspect of code development and deployment,&rdquo; said Shlomi Ben Haim, CEO of JFrog. "We are fueled by the community&rsquo;s feedback, so providing a trusted, secure, local Docker registry with Artifactory was part of the solution, and now we have completed the flow with our powerful software distribution platform, Bintray."</p>
<p>With established communities onboard such as Google Android, Apache Software Foundation, Groovy, Vagrant, HomeBrew, Spring-io and more, JFrog provides an end-to-end solution with Artifactory and Bintray for a multitude of binary or package types, and a fully automated continuous delivery pipeline for software development and deployment.</p>
<p>Today, with hundreds of millions of downloads per month, Bintray is a seasoned cloud platform, enabling developers to store, publish, download, promote, and share software. Thousands of open-source developers and DevOps teams worldwide use Bintray to serve over 100,000 software packages in leading environments.

Users can also follow any package and be notified whenever a new release is available for download.</p>
