<p><a href="https://logentries.com/" target="_blank">Logentries,</a>&nbsp;the leading log management and analytics service built for the cloud, today announced a free AWS CloudTrail log auditing service that automates the collection and tracking of security and resource utilization data using AWS CloudTrail data. The weekly reporting service provides an automated log-level view into valuable intelligence about AWS account changes, such as most common security related actions, most frequent errors, most active users, and an audit trail of account changes. Logentries and AWS customers need to simply sign-up in order to receive the email report delivered weekly.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://labs.logentries.com/cloudtrail-reports" target="_blank">The Free CloudTrail log auditing report</a>&nbsp;is part of a new Logentries service that provides log data analytics produced and verified by the Logentries Data Insights Team. In addition to centralizing, aggregating and filtering log data in real-time, Logentries now offers collection and visualizations of valuable metrics automatically delivered to users weekly. The reports are designed to provide valuable insights into log data without the need for users to perform complex analytics. The first of these reports will monitor and analyze CloudTrail log data with an overview metrics report including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>System activity over time (day, week, totals)</li>
<li>Most common security-related actions</li>
<li>Most active users</li>
<li>Instance launch and termination over time</li>
<li>Top successful user access by region</li>
<li>Top unauthorized user access by regions</li>
<li>Most frequent AWS errors</li>
<li>Breakdown of error types</li>
</ul>
<p>"Regular reports on important system activity gives us a valuable understanding of the state of our systems," said Prathibha Deshikachar, Director of Operations,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://adroll.com/" target="_blank">Adroll.com</a>. "By rolling up the most important CloudTrail analytics for us, the new Logentries Report eliminates the need for our teams to constantly dig deep into logs with complex queries."</p>
<p><strong>The Logentries Data Insights Service</strong></p>
<p>With billions of log events and data points streaming from across distributed infrastructure and cloud systems, many IT and Dev Ops teams are often overwhelmed by the amount of&nbsp;data their systems are producing. These teams are not only looking for tools that are built for cloud environments, but also provide a set of services to help them intelligently track, audit and understand their AWS infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Logentries Data Insights Service is built on Logentries' proprietary machine learning and community analytics technology, and supported by the Logentries Data Insights Team comprised of PhDs and applied research scientists in distributed systems. The free CloudTrail log auditing service collects relevant CloudTrail data and proactively tells users what they need to know to understand, at a glance, what's happening and where they need to take a closer look at their log data. For example, seeing log-in attempts from a region where no employees are located should alert the Ops team to potential security concerns that they would otherwise not have visibility into. Additionally, monitoring spikes in launches and terminations enables teams to pinpoint existing performance issues and even predict impending problems down the road.</p>
<p>"At Logentries we want to make life easier for our customers &ndash; we do the hard work so they don't have to," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Trevor Parsons</span>, Chief Scientist at Logentries. "The new Logentries Data Insights service provides users with access to expert analysis of important log data eliminating the need to hire their own data scientists and avoiding the unnecessary costs associated with learning and deploying traditional, more expensive alternatives."</p>
<p>The Logentries free AWS CloudTrail Reporting service will be available in May. Users interested in participating in the beta launch can sign up today at:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://labs.logentries.com/cloudtrail-reports" target="_blank">https://labs.logentries.com/cloudtrail-reports</a>.</p>
<p>The cloud-based Logentries service collects and pre-processes log events in real-time for on-demand analysis, alerting and visualization. With custom tagging and filtering, users can correlate data across their infrastructure to better understand application usage and performance, security and performance issues, and user behavior.
