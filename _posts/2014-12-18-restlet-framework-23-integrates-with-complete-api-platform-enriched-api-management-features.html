<p>Restlet, creators of the most widely deployed framework for APIs, today announced the general availability of Restlet Framework 2.3, their flagship open source project that is widely used by developers to create and use APIs for mobile, web, desktop and IoT applications. The 100,000-member-strong API development community has downloaded the project over 2 million times. This version constitutes the most significant upgrade to the Apache-licensed Restlet Framework in the last year.</p>
<p>The growth in use of RESTful APIs by both developers and consumers is driven by the exponential demand for diverse data-driven requirements in businesses. As developers need to target a variety of mobile and desktop devices, this creates more demand for reusable software components. The REST architecture style enables application developers to focus on creating the best user experience and features specific to each device.</p>
<p>Restlet Framework 2.3 is used both by the API developer - the person that creates APIs and makes them available for other developers, and the API consumer - the person that uses APIs to develop an application such as a mobile app or website, or to link connected objects to an enterprise backend.</p>
<p>New and enhanced features include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Addition of an APISpark extension that enables API developers to leverage Restlet&rsquo;s complete API platform to document, deploy and manage APIs created with Restlet Framework. This extension includes a web API introspector (compatible with JAX-RS API, Restlet API and Swagger annotations) and a firewall (IP filtering and rate limitation);</li>
<li>Upgrade to the Jetty extension with HTTP client and SPDY support contributed;</li>
<li>Contribution of a Google Guice extension;</li>
<li>Enhancements to the Swagger extension (compatibility with versions 1.2 and 2.0);</li>
<li>Addition of RAML extension;</li>
<li>Direct accessibility to the raw HTTP headers;</li>
<li>Enhancements to the internal connector (multi-threading, HTTPS server, FTP client).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to being used standalone, Restlet Framework is an integrant part of the Restlet platform to help developers manage the full API lifecycle. It is often integrated into a workflow which combines Restlet Framework with Restlet Studio for API crafting and APISpark for documentation, deployment, hosting and management of APIs.</p>
