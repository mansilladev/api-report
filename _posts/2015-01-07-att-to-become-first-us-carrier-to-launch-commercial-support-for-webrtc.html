<p>At the 2015&nbsp;<a href="https://devsummit.att.com/" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Developer Summit</a>&nbsp;today,&nbsp;<a href="http://about.att.com/" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a><span>1</span>&nbsp;announced that it will be the first US carrier to launch commercial support for Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) via its AT&amp;T Enhanced WebRTC&nbsp;<a href="http://about.att.com/mediakit/api" target="_blank">API</a>. The WebRTC standard, which is already enabled on more than a billion browsers, allows voice and video calling between browsers without the need to install any software or plugins.</p>
<p>The AT&amp;T Enhanced WebRTC API is now available in an open beta program and offers several enhancements to the basic WebRTC standard. The first enhancement is that Enhanced WebRTC communications can now extend to land lines and mobile numbers, not just P2P or browser-to browser sessions. This is valuable for developers and customers and will spur growth by eliminating a key barrier to adoption. A second enhancement is the ability for developers to programmatically enable Caller ID for WebRTC communications through the use of their end user's AT&amp;T mobile number, for calls placed from WebRTC-enabled browsers. Lastly, developers now can enable end users to move or transfer a call starting on a PC, MAC or tablet to a smartphone.</p>
<p>"AT&amp;T's powerful new Enhanced WebRTC API will allow developers to re-imagine phone and video calling experiences for our connected, IP&ndash;centric world," said AT&amp;T Mobility Chief Marketing Officer&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">David Christopher</span>&nbsp;during the Developer Summit. "WebRTC has been touted by analysts as one of the most disruptive communication technologies in years, and we think there will be rapid rise in the adoption of the standard and innovative development in what value it can create for businesses and consumers."</p>
<p>Plantronics, a leader in audio communications for businesses and consumers and one of the first beta partners and users of the technology, helped AT&amp;T kick off the launch of its Enhanced WebRTC API at the Summit.</p>
<p>"AT&amp;T and Plantronics have been at the forefront of communications trends for years and WebRTC is no exception," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Joe Burton</span>, EVP and CTO, Plantronics. "We were very excited to be an AT&amp;T beta partner for the Enhanced WebRTC API. The software development kit and code samples were very developer friendly and enabled us to quickly integrate our devices with the AT&amp;T Enhanced WebRTC API. This tight integration ensures a seamless customer communications experience via a web browser which is a true game changer."</p>
