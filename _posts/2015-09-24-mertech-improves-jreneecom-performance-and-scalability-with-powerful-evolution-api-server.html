<p><a href="http://www.mertech.com">Mertech</a>, a leading provider of database and API development tools, announced that The Remac Group&rsquo;s JRenee.com went live with Mertech&rsquo;s Evolution API Integration Platform allowing it to support five times the current load on its online store without requiring additional hardware. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Evolution facilitates cross-language development of APIs then serves those APIs using Apache Thrift binary, JSON-RPC and SOAP protocols. It helps companies share common business logic across desktop and web applications with the same code base by enabling seamless integration of program modules developed in different languages. This offers significant time and cost savings because developers can implement existing application functions in an API without having to worry about what front-end language is being used.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Evoluton has given us a very flexible way to expose our business logic for use with our online e-commerce site,&rdquo; said Coby Sparks, COO/CIO of The Remac Group. &ldquo;Our goal was to increase performance when using web services to call into our back-end functions from our online store. Using Evolution, and working with Mertech&rsquo;s services team, we exposed the needed business logic modules as API calls which were natively integrated into our PHP programs using binary protocol. At the same time,  Mertech&rsquo;s team helped streamline our e-commerce processing. We are experiencing excellent performance which translates to a much improved e-commerce customer experience. With Mertech&rsquo;s help we achieved our goal and couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;As we change from a PC-centric world to a user-centric world,  the biggest challenge companies face is how to integrate existing PC-based applications in a cloud infrastructure.  Evolution addresses that specific challenge,&rdquo; said Riaz Merchant, CEO of Mertech. &ldquo;APIs are today&rsquo;s most efficient method of application development.  The ability to use the same code base on PC and cloud infrastructures gives companies a very flexible way to adapt their technology stack without  making large scale investments.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Evolution also includes an API testing framework that provides an easy way to test APIs and facilitates communication between front-end and back-end developers. With this built-in API testing framework, back-end developers can test and refine API calls as they develop them, while front-end developers can immediately see the input and output without writing a line of code.</p>
