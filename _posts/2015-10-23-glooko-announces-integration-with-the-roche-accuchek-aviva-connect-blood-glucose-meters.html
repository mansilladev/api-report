<p><a href="http://www.glooko.com">Glooko Inc.</a>, the leading unified platform for diabetes management, today announced general availability of its integration with Roche&rsquo;s Accu-Chek Aviva Connect blood glucose meters to send blood glucose (BG) results automatically to the Glooko platform. Through wireless Bluetooth Smart technology built into these Accu-Chek Aviva Connect meters, the release enables near real-time syncing of blood glucose data to the Glooko platform without the need to connect cables. Data syncing happens in the background directly after blood glucose readings are measured by people using an Accu-Chek Aviva Connect meter.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With this latest integration, Glooko addresses a long-standing deterrent to tracking blood glucose trends: manual entry and syncing of blood glucose data into apps and disease management systems to help patients and clinicians better manage diabetes. When people with diabetes use a Bluetooth enabled Accu-Chek Aviva Connect meter, they simply have to check their blood glucose and their data becomes automatically available in Glooko, where it is combined with exercise, diet, CGM, pump and medication data in a series of reports and analytics.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Traditional mobile health solutions that require manual entry of BG data have struggled to capture accurate data and keep users engaged, resulting in missing data points and an inability to review accurate glucose trends necessary for diabetes decision making. With its support for Accu-Chek Aviva Connect meters, Glooko builds on its device-agnostic platform, which is focused on making diabetes management easier through data accessibility and advanced analytics.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are excited that Glooko has chosen to add the Accu-Chek Aviva Connect meter to its platform,&rdquo; said Laura Spiegel, Group Marketing Manager of Strategy and Innovation at Roche Diagnostics Corporation. &ldquo;By adding our Bluetooth enabled meter to its lineup, Glooko is able to leverage seamless access to blood glucose data in order to deliver actionable information that is accessible near real time. Individuals using Accu-Chek Aviva Connect can easily share this information with their care team to support better decisions and care adjustments for positive health outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With this new integration to the Glooko platform, a patient&rsquo;s family members and their care team can use the Glooko mobile and web apps to remotely monitor their blood glucose as well as other important information, such as insulin, carb and fitness data in a single platform. The patient&rsquo;s care team can also access this information and connect with patients who require more attention. &ldquo;In situations where a patient is experiencing dangerous hypoglycemic events, Roche&rsquo;s seamless transfer of blood glucose data through Glooko in near real time to the smartphone triggers Glooko to engage patients in creating better hypoglycemic awareness via the Joslin HypoMap&trade; survey and other pattern recognition features, giving patients and their care teams the ability to actively mitigate these issues,&rdquo; said Michelle de Haaff, Glooko&rsquo;s Vice President of Marketing.</p>
