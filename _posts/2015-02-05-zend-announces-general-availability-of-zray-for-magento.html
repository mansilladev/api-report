<p>"At Envoy, we think Z-Ray is a bit of a revolution in debugging tools. It will help improve the efficiency of any developer who uses Magento.&nbsp; Z-Ray gives developers insights into complicated&nbsp;Magento&nbsp;architecture by grouping information into human-readable tabs, lists and tables. It is a real-time tool which can change the way you work with&nbsp;Magento, making your team more efficient and error-free." - Marcin Szterling, Head of Magento, Envoy</p>
<p>"Magento sites can be complex and often times suffer poor performance due to complicated business logic and a large volume of database queries.&nbsp;There are many elements that go into the final construction of a rendered page, with so much going on under the hood it can be difficult to quickly back trace issues in a crunch.&nbsp; Z-Ray gives us the necessary insight to guarantee all of our client Magento applications reach their peak performance and stay there with each release." -&nbsp;Mathew Beane,&nbsp;Director of Systems Engineering, Robofirm</p>
<p>"Over time, Magento development can often become heavy and complex when several developers are working on the same platform. Z-Ray provides a lot of information about what is happening 'under the hood,' allowing us to easily detect the causes of performance problems and quickly fix them." -&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Pierre Fay</span>, Magento expert and consultant</p>
