<p>Oilfield market research firm <a href="http://energentgroup.com">Energent Group</a> released their interactive completions and frac data platform to identify what materials are used in the well completion process and <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbmVyZ2VudGdyb3VwLmNvbQ==">identify proppant and downhole chemical trends</a>.</p>
<p>As exploration and production companies continue to focus on costs and well performance, completions become a major differentiator in the highly competitive oil &amp; gas industry. Many horizontal shale completions have adopted high intensity completions, which has led to more proppant being used, more stages, and often better well results. Energent Group&rsquo;s proppant and oilfield chemical data allow asset teams to identify, review, and analyze nearby well completion designs. The data and software complement existing Upstream solutions provided by IHS, DrillingInfo, and RigData.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We find that our users may have access to existing Upstream software but spend a considerable amount of time analyzing the data in spreadsheets. With our interactive reports, we aim to reduce a user&rsquo;s spreadsheet time by 40%. Our clients take advantage of high-level market reports to explore trends, then jump to the well-level detail water, proppant, chemicals, casing, and tubing information to understand offset well detail,&rdquo; said Boyd Skelton, co-founder of Energent Group.</p>
<p>While competitors have focused on the higher end of the market, Energent Group&rsquo;s solutions target the broader spectrum of operators, oilfield service companies, and suppliers navigating the tough oil &amp; gas industry environment. With U.S. shale being anointed the world&rsquo;s new &ldquo;swing producer,&rdquo; Energent Group&rsquo;s solutions are set to shake up the industry with affordable insights for both newcomers and established players. Businesses looking to integrate permits, well completions, well tests, frac jobs, and well header data can do so via an easy-to-use application programming interface (API).</p>
