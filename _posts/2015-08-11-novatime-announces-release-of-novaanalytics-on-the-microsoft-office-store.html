<p><a href="http://www.novatime.com">NOVAtime Technology, Inc.</a>, a leading provider of enterprise Time and Attendance / Workforce Management solutions, has announced its recent release of the NOVAanalytics app on the Microsoft Office Store. Available for use with NOVAtime 5000 SaaS, the app harnesses the power of web APIs to download NOVAtime workforce data in real-time to Microsoft Excel. The app also provides users with a range of configurable templates that allow even the least technical user to transform messy raw data into insightful reports with a clean, professional design that will meet virtually any business need.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">NOVAanalytics allows up-t0-date labor data to be shared securely across many devices. President and CEO Frank Su explains the significance of the app&rsquo;s use of web APIs, &ldquo;Using NOVAanalytics, individual NOVAtime 5000 SaaS customers will, for the first time, be able to access real-time NOVAtime data in Excel without performing an export to Excel every time refreshed data is needed or writing a piece of code for a web service call.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Developed with the non-technical user in mind, NOVAanalytics enables these users to create ad hoc reports, interactive data visualizations, presentations, and dashboards on their own, without requiring assistance from IT personnel or programmers. Configurable templates combined with all the functionality of Excel, including versatile Pivot tables and querying capabilities, provide endless options for data visualization. According to Scott Rose, VP of Sales, &ldquo;The term &rsquo;big data&rsquo; is on everyone&rsquo;s lips these days, but few companies have the time or resources to analyze all of the data they collect and make effective decisions based on their analysis. With NOVAanalytics, our customers will have a simple, yet powerful business intelligence tool designed for people who aren&rsquo;t business intelligence analysts.&rdquo;</p>
