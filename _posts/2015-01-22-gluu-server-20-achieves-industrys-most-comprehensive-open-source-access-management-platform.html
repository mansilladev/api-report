<p><a href="http://www.gluu.org/">Gluu</a> today announced the availability of the Gluu Server 2.0, its industry leading open source access management platform for API security. Today all Internet domains need to identify both people and machines over the Internet, and to control access to APIs. The Gluu Server enables domains to support both older standards for security (like SAML and CAS) and newer standards based on OAuth2. With this release, the Gluu Server becomes the most comprehensive free open source security stack on the market.<br /><br />The Gluu Server uses only free open source components, which makes it also the only open source access management platform that can be used in production environments without a commercial license. Gluu offers community and enterprise VIP support, and discounted rates to educational institutions worldwide.<br /><br />New Gluu Server CE key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of the Shibboleth SAML IDP and Asimba SAML proxy for outbound and inbound SAML single sign-on.</li>
<li>Inclusion of a CAS Server to make transitioning to SAML and OAuth2 easier.</li>
<li>New interception scripts capabilities, which enable a domain to customize the behavior of the Gluu server using Python, Javascript or Java.</li>
</ul>
