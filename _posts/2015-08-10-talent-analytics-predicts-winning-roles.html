<p><a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/">Talent Analytics, Corp</a>. today announced the immediate availability of &ldquo;Winning Roles&trade;&rdquo; predictions. Winning Roles predictions, embedded in Talent Analytics&rsquo; Advisor&trade; platform, instantly predict the likelihood of one person&rsquo;s success in several (or many) roles.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Winning Roles predictions identify which roles would deliver the most value to the organization while providing the greatest opportunity for success and engagement for the candidate. Advisor&rsquo;s elegant dashboard instantly delivers a prediction about the candidate's optimal role.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to being an indispensable utility for hiring external candidates, Talent Analytics expects organizations to use Winning Roles predictions to identify the most interesting and successful career paths for its top employees. By identifying paths where they are predicted to thrive, the employee can advance their career while the organization retains its top performers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Within a single dashboard view, Talent Analytics&rsquo; Winning Roles predictions allows data scientists to upload and update candidate prediction models. This enables hiring managers and HR leaders to instantly identify great candidates, dynamically compare them to multiple open positions, and place the candidate where those models predict them to succeed. Advisor is the only platform on the market today that brings together both the business and science of workforce planning,&rdquo; according to Chad Harness, VP and Lead Human Capital Analytics Consultant at a large regional US bank.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By way of example, one person&rsquo;s success could be predicted in an open Bank Teller, Call Center and Bank Intern role. Advisor instantly identifies the Winning Roles predictions for the individual&rsquo;s success in each of these roles. After being hired into one of these roles, this same individual could have their success predicted in a more advanced sales, technical or operations role.</p>
