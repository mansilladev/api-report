<p><a href="http://www.telenav.com/">Telenav</a>&reg;, Inc. (Nasdaq:&nbsp;<a title="TNAV" rel="nofollow" href="http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=TNAV" target="_blank">TNAV</a>), the leader in location-based services, today announced that <a href="http://www.skullysystems.com/#smartest-helmet">SKULLY Systems</a> has selected Telenav's Scout SDK to deliver navigation features in their highly anticipated SKULLY AR-1 helmet. SKULLY Systems, makers of the world's first augmented reality motorcycle helmet, will leverage Telenav's Scout SDK to provide the software foundations that will enable real-time, turn-by-turn navigation for the AR-1's heads-up display.</p>
<p>Launched in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">May 2014</span>, Telenav's Scout SDK is the first commercial-grade platform for mobile developers worldwide that is based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) &ndash; a crowd-sourced map of the world that provides more details and updates than Google Maps &ndash; or any other commercially available licensed maps. Telenav's Scout SDK is also the first widely-available navigation SDK to offer hybrid (online and offline) navigation using OSM.</p>
<p>Developing a safe and easily accessible motorcycle navigation solution presents unique engineering challenges that traditional navigation systems are ill-equipped to address. Because Telenav's Scout SDK is highly customizable &ndash; and can work in any driving scenario &ndash; SKULLY can utilize the routing prompts and deliver a tailored solution that fits within the display of a small window inside the AR-1 helmet.</p>

<p>"We are creating new safety technologies for motorcycling with the SKULLY AR-1. It provides drivers with a navigation experience designed specifically with the motorcyclist in mind," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Marcus Weller</span>, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of SKULLY. "We needed a flexible and highly robust platform for navigation, and Telenav's SDK met our rigorous criteria. We are able to create truly awesome features that motorcyclists have never had before."</p>
<p>"SKULLY Systems is quickly being recognized for the incredible innovation it is bringing to motorcycle technology, and we are proud that they have chosen Telenav's Scout SDK to power the navigation experience for their customers," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rohan Chandran</span>, president and general manager of Telenav's mobile division. "SKULLY Systems, as with other members of Telenav's Scout for Developers program, have found the Scout SDK to be a flexible and invaluable tool for creating applications that offer easy integration, coupled with the latest mapping data that consistently tracks an endlessly evolving road infrastructure. We look forward to collaborating with SKULLY Systems to provide motorcycle drivers with an unprecedented driving experience."</p>
<p>SKULLY Systems joins companies including Inrix, Strava, TripAdvisor and Triposo in Telenav's Scout for Developers program. The SKULLY AR-1 helmet is slated for availability in spring 2015.</p>
