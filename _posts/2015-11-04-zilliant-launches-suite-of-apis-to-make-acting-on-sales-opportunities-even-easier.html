<p><a href="http://www.zilliant.com">Zilliant</a>, a leading provider of prescriptive selling applications that drive financial growth, today announced the launch of a suite of application program interfaces (APIs) for SalesMax and Zilliant Visual Analytics. These new capabilities will enable B2B sales reps to more easily access sales opportunities and contextual analytics in the CRM and order management tools they are accustomed to using.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new suite of APIs enables the cross-sell and retention opportunities generated by SalesMax to be delivered in any visual format or tool. It includes a closed-loop system capability to enable sales managers to measure and track results and sales rep performance. The suite of APIs also includes a visual analytics API which delivers contextual analytics in any system in support of pricing and sales opportunity recommendations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our customers can now more easily deliver precisely targeted prescriptive selling guidance, anytime, anywhere,&rdquo; said Pete Eppele, senior vice president of products and science at Zilliant. &ldquo;By embedding Zilliant&rsquo;s advanced analytics in existing processes and tools, it is easier for sales reps to know which customers to call, what products to pitch, and what prices to quote. This ultimately accelerates adoption, enabling B2B sales teams to retain and win more business.&rdquo;</p>
