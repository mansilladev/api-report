<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.host1plus.com/press/host1plus-now-accepts-bitcoin-payments/">announcement</a>, released on Tuesday, the collaboration with <a href="http://coinzone.com/">Coinzone</a> is intended to improve customers&rsquo; buying experience. Cryptocurrency payments are seen as a great alternative to traditional payment methods. While Host1Plus provides web hosting services worldwide, transactions in Bitcoin are expected to help customers avoid credit card payments and cross-border fees.</p>
<p>Andrius Kazlauskas, the co-founder and CEO of Host1Plus, states that the growing relevance of Bitcoin has highly influenced the decision to enable Bitcoin payments for the clients.</p>
<p>The two companies have engaged in a long and thoughtful preparation and discussion. The extra time spent on perfecting the system is supposed to add to improved security and functionality.</p>
<p>Alex Tarla, the CTO of Coinzone, said, "As Bitcoin is growing steadily in popularity among users, we observe a natural reaction of merchants that are adopting this type of payment channel for their online customers. In this case, the integration process was straight forward in part because of the close collaboration between our two teams and because of the flexible, yet robust Merchant API exposed by Coinzone payment gateway platform. The end result is a friendly and secure online payment experience."</p>

The Coinzone solution includes an online check-out page available in 11 languages, integration with top online shopping carts such as Magento, Prestashop and WooCommerce, mobile Point-of-Sale apps for Android and iPad/iPhone and a versatile API for custom integrations.</p>
<p>Regarding Bitcoin news today, digital payments are on the rise. Even so, some companies don&rsquo;t see Bitcoin as a valid payment and are still concerned about the security and volatility. While Bitcoin transaction volume is among the highest ever, the rise in recent adoptions show that Bitcoin is not going away, despite a few setbacks.</p>
<p>Headquartered in the Netherlands, the Coinzone team has 70+ years of experience with both international e-commerce and payments. Coinzone&rsquo;s mission is to provide the best user experience that eliminates geographic boundaries and complexities of payments by enabling businesses and individuals in Europe and growth markets to easily store and transact digital currencies.</p>
