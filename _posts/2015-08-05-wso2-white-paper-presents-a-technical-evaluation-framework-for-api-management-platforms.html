<p>In an increasingly connected world, APIs are an organization&rsquo;s core business product, exposing valuable services across customers, partners, and supplier channels. <a href="http://wso2.com/whitepapers/api-management-platform-technical-evaluation-framework">A newly expanded white paper from WSO2 outlines a technical evaluation framework for API management platforms, including capabilities of the WSO2 API Management Platform, to help achieve digital business goals</a>.</p>
<p>The white paper, &ldquo;API Management Platform Technical Evaluation Framework,&rdquo; begins by discussing the goals of digital business innovation and how internal development teams, external partners, and third-party developers can accelerate business innovation by composing solutions from ready-made API building blocks. The paper then examines transformative API-oriented IT initiatives, including the API-centric enterprise, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT), microservices architecture, and API management, among others.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Next, the paper explores the categories of API management platform requirements. It also provides a comparison evaluation matrix spreadsheet that details hundreds of evaluation criteria an organization can use to score vendor platforms. The paper then concludes by examining the capabilities of the WSO2 API management platform.</p>
