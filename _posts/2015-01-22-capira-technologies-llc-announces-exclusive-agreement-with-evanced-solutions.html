<p><a href="http://www.capiratech.com/">Capira Technologies LLC</a>, a software and mobile application technology developer for libraries, announced an exclusive collaboration with Evanced&trade; (a Demco Company), a provider of innovative software solutions for libraries, to develop an API that will allow seamless integration between the companies&rsquo; CapiraMobile&copy; and SignUp&trade; flagship products.</p>
<p>SignUp&trade; is a simple but powerful event calendar management solution from Evanced&trade; that makes it easy for patrons to sign up for library events. The API, currently under development, will provide patrons using CapiraMobile&copy; with quick and easy &ldquo;1-Click Signup&rdquo; for events listed in their library&rsquo;s SignUp&trade; program, all without having to leave the app, and without having to log in to SignUp&trade; every time and fill out their information. The mobile application will be able to seamlessly pass library credentials stored on a patron&rsquo;s mobile device to the API, making program registration even easier. In addition, patrons using CapiraMobile&copy; will be able to conveniently display a list of all the events that they are currently registered for within the mobile application itself. Under the agreement, Capira Technologies and their mobile clients will have exclusive rights to the 1-Click Signup API for a year.</p>
<p>Capira Technologies, LLC and Evanced&trade; will be available at the 2015 American Library Association Midwinter conference in Chicago, January 30 &ndash; February 2 at Booths #1735 and #4211, respectively to speak more about this exciting new collaboration.</p>
