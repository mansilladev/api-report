<p><a href="http://www.usefulfeedback.com/">UsefulFeedback</a> has released a dedicated on demand SaaS solution to help UK finance firms meet the requirements set out by the FCA in its recent policy statement &lsquo;PS15/19: Improving complaints handling, feedback on CP14/30 and final rules&rsquo;. This policy was developed following the FCA's Thematic Review of complaint handling during 2014.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Hans Grefte, Managing Director of UsefulFeedback, said: &ldquo;The policy statement stipulates five main points as new requirements for firms. These look to be straightforward enough, however there are significant implications for the systems and tools that the finance sector uses to manage customer complaints.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Hans Grefte continues: &ldquo;One of the new requirements is to report all complaints. Currently, complaints resolved by the end of the next working day by frontline staff in a less formal way do not need to be reported. The requirement for 2016 to report all complaints means there is a need to put an appropriate complaint management solution at the fingertips of frontline staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The FCA published the findings of the review in November 2014 in a previous document &lsquo;Thematic Review TR14/18: Complaint handling&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This document identified a learning opportunity. It noted a lack of access to systems, an inconsistent approach across firms and the potential for inaccuracy and duplication in processes. The lesson is to consider how best to avoid consumer frustration when complaints are inaccurately recorded and to make accurate recording simple and easy for frontline staff,&rdquo; Hans Grefte said.</p>
