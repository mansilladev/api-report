<p><a href="http://reco2.me/">The RECO line exists for one reason</a>--to give users a pain-free operational experience. Following up on the success of the&nbsp;RECO Beacon, Perples Inc. is officially launching its revolutionary masterpiece, the&nbsp;RECO Manager, on July 8th.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We recognized that businesses of all sizes were struggling with the amount of resources beacon system management required,&rdquo; said Hoon Song, Chief Executive Officer, Perples, Inc. &ldquo;That is why we have developed the RECO Manager. We want to help businesses easily manage beacon systems of any size.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">RECO Manager functions as a control beacon, connecting your beacon system to the web and allowing remote management of all beacons in its range from anywhere in the world through the web-based RECO Cloud Console. While previous BLE beacons offered businesses a myriad of new ways to interact with their customers, each beacon still required individual on-site management. Perples eliminates this and other hassles with RECO Manager, even allowing users to easily integrate beacon management functions into their existing management systems with the included RECO Cloud API.</p>
