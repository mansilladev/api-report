<p><a href="http://opennetsummit.org/">Open Networking Summits, Inc. (ONS)</a> represents the industry&rsquo;s premier and only non-profit conference that brings together the entire networking ecosystem to discuss advances in software-defined networking (SDN), OpenFlow, and network functions virtualization (NFV) to accelerate adoption and shape the future of the networking industry.</p>
<p>Open Networking Summit 2015, today announced Cavium&rsquo;s XPliant&reg; Switch as the winner of <a title="SDN Idol 2015" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL29wZW5uZXRzdW1taXQub3JnL2NvbmZlcmVuY2UvYWdlbmRhL3Nkbi1pZG9sLw==">SDN Idol 2015</a>, the industry&rsquo;s top award for the year&rsquo;s hottest SDN solutions.</p>
<p>SDN Idol is a fun, friendly award competition that showcases disruptive SDN technologies, products or use cases from exhibitors at the annual Open Networking Summit. The top four SDN Idol submissions are selected by an esteemed panel of judges and the winner is chosen following live demonstrations and a live voting process by an audience that boasts SDN practitioners and enthusiasts across end-user, vendors, investors, academia, media and analysts.</p>
<p>The Judges for SDN Idol 2015 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geng Lin, CTO of Corporate Networks, Google&nbsp;</li>
<li>Jim Smith, General Partner, Mohr Davidow Ventures&nbsp;</li>
<li>Tom Anschutz, Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, AT&amp;t&nbsp;</li>
<li>Zeus Kerravala, Founder &amp; Principal Analyst, ZK Research</li>
</ul>
<p>The four finalists for SDN Idol 2015 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cavium, XPliant Switch&nbsp;</li>
<li>Huawei, 2015 SDN IDOL &ndash; DN-based IP &amp; Optical Synergy&nbsp;</li>
<li>NEC, SDN Cyber Attack Auto Protection&nbsp;</li>
<li>Pluribus Networks, Integrated Network Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>The top four finalists were chosen by a panel of industry experts and judged on the following criteria: business value, technology value, differentiation against competition, advancement of overall SDN, and live demo performance.</p>
<p>ONS attendees then voted to select Cavium&rsquo;s XPliant switch as winner of SDN Idol 2015. The SDN Idol Award was presented to Cavium on June 18th, during the Open Networking Summit 2015. The conference attracted over 1,200 attendees from around the world and had participation from over 70 organizations in the Exhibit Hall.</p>
<p>Cavium, Inc., a leading provider of semiconductor products that enable intelligent processing for enterprise, data center, cloud, wired and wireless networking announced the demonstration of the OpenFlow and OpenFlow-Hybrid XPliant&reg;-based platforms for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) at ONS 2015.  Cavium&rsquo;s XPliant Ethernet switches deliver high-speed support in OpenFlow through XPliant&rsquo;s SDK APIs and integration of Open vSwitch (OVS).</p>
<p>Existing silicon switch solutions map OpenFlow constructs to fixed pipelines and tables intended for historical switching protocols. These solutions do not provide the flexibility that network operators require in order to effectively control and automate their networks. In addition these architectures leverage shallow TCAM resources that do not provide the desired level of scalability.</p>
<p>Cavium's XPliant Ethernet switch silicon combines the highest level of flexibility and performance, unprecedented in the networking industry. The revolutionary XPA architecture incorporates programmable tables as well as flexible lookups and editing of packets with high throughput. These architectural features enable native support of extremely flexible OpenFlow defined switching implementations, for high performance SDN applications at mega scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Software Defined Networking is now migrating from a discussion to actual implementation in the real world&rdquo;, said Eric Hayes, VP/GM, Switch Platform Group at Cavium, &ldquo;The XPliant protocol independent programmable switch silicon is providing a platform for innovation to further this reality&rdquo;</p>
<p>Combining the XPliant flexible programmable switch silicon with the emerging leading software open ecosystem opens the door to modern networking deployments of SDN applications to achieve high performance and scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s SDN Idol was very competitive and every participant presented the most innovative SDN technologies ONS has ever seen. We are very pleased to announce Cavium as the reigning SDN Idol 2015 and this accomplishment exemplifies how data planes take Openflow and SDN to the next level of customization and programmability&rdquo; said Vaibhav Parulkar, program manager of ONS2015. &ldquo;It will be very interesting to see the scale of live SDN and NFV deployments over the course of 2015, the emerging use cases and the variety of new business models that these solutions will enable. This industry is innovating so rapidly that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what disruptive solutions will be demoed at SDN Idol 2016 and we look forward to seeing what next year will bring.&rdquo;</p>
