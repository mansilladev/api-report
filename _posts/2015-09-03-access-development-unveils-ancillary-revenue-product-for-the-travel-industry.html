<p>Airlines, hotels, online travel agencies (OTAs) and other travel-related companies can now add additional profit to each customer booking, thanks to All City Savings, a new turnkey ancillary revenue product from Access Development.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">All City Savings features destination-specific discount packages in every major US market, including deals of up to 50% off on dining, entertainment, shopping, other attractions, and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found All City Savings to be a consistent revenue source with an obvious value proposition,&rdquo; says Roger Williams, managing director at Perk.es and an All City Savings client. &ldquo;The customers save on destination-specific activities they already have an interest in, and the travel provider adds more revenue to each sale without having to handle fulfillment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Another early client, a major international airline, has added significant profit on each booking that included an All City Savings discount pass conversion. (Click here to read a detailed case study regarding that client&rsquo;s implementation.) Other early clients have noted the program&rsquo;s easy integration and high conversion rates.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The profit margins on airline or hotel bookings can be thin, so the revenue All City Savings generates is significant because it&rsquo;s pure profit,&rdquo; says Kelly Passey, Access Development EVP of business and product development. &ldquo;Since customers can easily recoup the cost of their discount pass several times over, it makes for an easy purchase decision. They&rsquo;ll come back to book with the same travel provider in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Integration of All City Savings can be as simple as adding a hyperlink, but clients can tap into the real-time Access APIs to customize their own integration. The transactions and fulfillment are all managed by Access, who provides a share of the revenue back to the referring client.</p>
