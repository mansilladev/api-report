<p><a href="https://pokitdok.com/">PokitDok</a>&nbsp;today announced a strategic alliance with Doctor On Demand, the next generation telemedicine provider that offers Video Visits with Board Certified Physicians, Psychologists, and other providers. In its mission to streamline the operations behind all healthcare delivery, PokitDok is lifting time-consuming administrative burdens tied to virtual medical visits.

<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;By licensing our APIs, Doctor On Demand is helping improve their patient experience by seamlessly connecting to insurance eligibility and submitting a claim for treatment in real-time behind the scenes so focus remains on the patient-physician conversation, where it should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The global telemedicine technology market is expected to reach&nbsp;$43B in 2019, paved in part by 22 states and the District of Columbia requiring private insurers to cover&nbsp;telehealth&nbsp;the same way they cover in-person healthcare services. The rapid adoption and popularity of telemedicine for non-emergent conditions ranging anywhere from colds, flus, UTIs, and upper respiratory infections, has made Doctor On Demand&rsquo;s breakthrough technology a popular choice for employers, health plans, and consumers in general. Employers and health plans save money by reducing urgent care and emergency room usage, and employees gain access to quality care in the comfort of their own home.</p>
<p>"At Doctor On Demand, we help employers reduce their healthcare costs while providing easy access to some of the best doctors and other providers in the country. Employers and patients want the ability to use Doctor On Demand's service through their insurance plan,&rdquo; Said Adam Jackson, Co-founder and CEO, Doctor On Demand. &ldquo;PokitDok's suite of APIs allows us to do that by checking the patient's eligibility and then submitting a claim for their visit directly to the insurance provider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor On Demand is using PokitDok&rsquo;s application programming interfaces (APIs) to accelerate information exchange to determine what services are covered by health insurance and to submit claims for medical care across PokitDok&rsquo;s 177 insurance partners, which represent 79% of covered lives nationwide. The APIs enable consumers and self-insured employers to use telehealth services through their insurance plan. Doctor On Demand has a network of more than 1400 Board Certified physicians and 300 psychologists overseen by Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pat Basu, M.D., a former Stanford physician and White House fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By licensing our APIs, Doctor On Demand is helping improve their patient experience by seamlessly connecting to insurance eligibility and submitting a claim for treatment in real-time behind the scenes so focus remains on the patient-physician conversation, where it should be.&rdquo; Said Lisa Maki, CEO of PokitDok &ldquo;This is yet another great example of how the PokitDok Platform can be used to streamline the operations behind healthcare delivery."</p>
