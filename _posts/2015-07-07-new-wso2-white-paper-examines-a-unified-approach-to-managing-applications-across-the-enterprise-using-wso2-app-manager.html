<p class="responsiveNews">In today&rsquo;s connected world, on-boarding new employees carries increasing challenges for enterprise IT organizations tasked with providing role-appropriate access to a range of Web, cloud, mobile and legacy apps. A new white paper from WSO2 looks at the emergence of &ldquo;workspace aggregator&rdquo; solutions within the enterprise, such as WSO2 App Manager, to provide a unified application management strategy for addressing this challenge.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The white paper, &ldquo;The Engaged Organization in a Connected World: Managing Applications through Workspace Aggregators,&rdquo; begins by discussing how workspace aggregators are helping IT departments to support end-user access to legacy apps, while embracing mobility and device diversity. The paper then focuses on how consolidated management across Web, and mobile apps and data enables effective delivery of resources to the right users on the right devices.</p>

It then explores how this benefits enterprise IT with enhanced compliance to organization segregation of duties via role-based app access.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, the paper examines the WSO2 App Manager architecture and deployment model. It then concludes by discussing how a one-stop app store with a consumer app store-like experience offers a significant step forward in making employee on-boarding processes both efficient and hassle-free.</p>
