<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about the Berlin program. We&rsquo;re covering all the things you&rsquo;d expect on APIs in sessions, but we&rsquo;re offering other formats too,&rdquo; said Steve Willmott, CEO of 3scale and co-organizer of APIStrat. &ldquo;We have the conference must-haves you expect, but we added SpeedHack and the Birds of a Feather, as well to provide all conference attendees with an outstanding experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, there will also be a special hardware presentation of API technology in action by&nbsp;<a title="API Cocktails" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2FwaWRheXNiZXJsaW4yMDE1LmFwaXN0cmF0LmNvbS9jdXN0b21pemUteW91ci1jb2NrdGFpbC1hdC1hcGlkYXlzYXBpc3RyYXQtcG93ZXJlZC1ieS1mb29kcGFpcmluZy8=">Foodpairing</a>&reg;.
