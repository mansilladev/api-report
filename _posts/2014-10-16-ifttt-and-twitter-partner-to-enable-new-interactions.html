<p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/powerful-new-connections-to-twitter-just-released-for-ifttt">If This Then That (IFTTT) and Twitter have partnered to provide new Twitter i</a>nteractions&nbsp;that are possible, enabling Twitter users to further automate, synchronize, and personalize their Twitter experience.</p>
<p>In the IFTTT world, these statements are known as recipes and they are made of components known as triggers and actions, and the two companies have partnered to release a number of new entries in both areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong> 
<ul>
<li>New Tweet from Search (new)</li>
<li>New Tweet by specific user (new)</li>
<li>New mention of you (new)</li>
<li>New Tweet by anyone in area (new)</li>
<li>New Tweet by you</li>
<li>New Tweet by you with hashtag</li>
<li>New Tweet by you in area</li>
<li>New link by you</li>
<li>New follower</li>
<li>New favorite Tweet by you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Post a Tweet</li>
<li>Post a Tweet with image</li>
<li>Send a direct message to yourself</li>
<li>Update profile picture</li>
<li>Update bio</li>
<li>Add user to list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the new triggers and actions, users can orchestrate the desired outcome by mixing different combinations, generating specific recipes they can use to orchestrate the Twitter experience desired, beyond what you can do with your Twitter account alone.</p>
<p>IFTTT has had a handful of Twitter related triggers and actions to date, but at times have had friction with Twitter, and this new release of features reflect a new era of partnering between the two service providers--investing in features users can benefit from.</p>
