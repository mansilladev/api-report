<p>Answering the need for a quick, easy modernization solution,&nbsp;<a href="http://openlegacy.com/">OpenLegacy</a>&nbsp;is announcing the global roll-out of its open source platform that helps enterprises integrate their legacy IT systems with mobile, Web and cloud applications.</p>
<p>As part of its official global launch, the company has opened offices in the New York area, and expanded the US-based management team with chief operating officer, Hans Otharsson, and senior vice president of sales Rolin Zumaran, both previously vice presidents at Software AG.</p>
<p>OpenLegacy is a standards-based open source development platform, which any developer can download and immediately start transforming and deploying legacy into modern&nbsp;applications in a DIY manner, at no cost. The OpenLegacy Pro edition is subscription based, and includes management features, security, support and high availability options.</p>
<p>Consumers and employees have become accustomed to having anytime/anywhere access to all types of information, through mobile devices, Web or cloud applications. Yet modernizing legacy systems to meet this demand &ndash; either by extending with new software, or replacing them outright &ndash; can be expensive, complex and time consuming. Until now, CIOs have had to choose between leaving the legacy system as is, or embarking on a pricey multi-year modernization project.</p>
<p>For executives that are stymied by the risks, time and costs of traditional legacy modernization approaches, OpenLegacy&rsquo;s API-based platform offers immediate benefits. Significantly, it can be implemented in a matter of days instead of weeks or months. The new platform will meet a growing demand in the global market for an easy, cost-effective solution to the challenges of legacy modernization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Reliable legacy solutions such as mainframes and IBM System i &ndash; formerly known as AS/400 &ndash; are here to stay; they process billions of critical transactions per day, such as credit cards and bank transfers,&rdquo; said Romi Stein, OpenLegacy&rsquo;s CEO and co-founder. &ldquo;The challenge is to help the &lsquo;grandaddy of all IT systems&rsquo; be compatible with today&rsquo;s requirements for mobile, Web and cloud integration, and this is where OpenLegacy fits in.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>OpenLegacy will be exhibiting at several upcoming industry events, including the Wisconsin Midrange Computer Professional Association Spring Technical Conference, March 10 - 12, 2015 in Delavan, WI; the Northeast User Groups Conference, March 30 - April 1, in Framingham, MA; and COMMON&rsquo;s largest educational event of the year, April 26 - 29, 2015, Disneyland&reg; Resort in Anaheim, CA.</p>
