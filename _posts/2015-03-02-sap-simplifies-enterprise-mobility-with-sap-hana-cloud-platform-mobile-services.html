<p><strong>Delivering Innovation in the Cloud&nbsp;<br /></strong>SAP HANA Cloud Platform mobile services help customers build and deploy native and hybrid mobile apps that integrate securely with on-premise or cloud-based systems.

<p>SAP HANA Cloud Platform mobile services are also fully interoperable with the cloud-based&nbsp;SAP&reg; Mobile Secure&nbsp;portfolio to provide management and security options at the device, content and app level. Additionally, one-click deployment from mobile services to the SAP Mobile Place tool offers quick, easy discovery, downloading and provisioning of apps on both managed and unmanaged devices, similar to commercial app stores.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Performance for On-Premise Use</strong><br />The latest release of SAP Mobile Platform 3.0, SP06, shares the same new optimized data synchronization capabilities for app development as SAP HANA Cloud Platform mobile services and adds additional enhancements such as support for new authentication protocols and high-availability clustering support.</p>
<p><strong>Fast App Development&nbsp;</strong><br />The latest release of the SAP Mobile Platform software development kit (SDK) includes a harmonized API to help simplify development of online and offline applications, enabling developers to be more productive. Device support is now included for new device operating systems such as the recently released iOS 8. SAP Web IDE provides a Web-based development environment that helps users build and extend applications easily with SAP Fiori, using SAP HANA Cloud Platform.</p>
