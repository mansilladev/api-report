<p>"With commodity markets in a period of rapid change - news of geopolitical uncertainties, swings in outlook and trade flow shifts - the need for timely cross-commodity pricing data has never been more important,"&nbsp; said&nbsp;<strong>Marina Goche</strong>, director of Platts product development &amp; management. "Now with&nbsp;<strong><em>Market Data Direct,&nbsp;</em></strong>and its instant delivery of Platts data, traders and asset managers can gain deep market insight quickly and more confidently adjust trading and portfolio allocations to changing market conditions."&nbsp;</p>

Data is available by individual commodity price assessment as soon as it is published, eliminating the time lag associated with packaged collections traditionally offered hours later. &nbsp;</p>
