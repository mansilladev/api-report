<p><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, the choice of more than two million software professionals for building and delivering the world&rsquo;s best applications, has made two major enhancements to Collaborator, the only tool available that allows peer review of code, user stories, test plans, Excel files and other documentation. The new JSON API functionality allows integrations with other products including bug-tracking (JIRA), continuous integration (Jenkins), IDE, SCM and other third party tools. Collaborator 9.0 also now allows the ability to create a review from within Eclipse with Git as the SCM.<br /><br />&ldquo;The new JSON API provides Collaborator 9.0 with the foundation needed to drive integrations for both our customers and partners, ensuring improved performance with our existing integrations and with third party tools in the future,&rdquo; said Justin Collier, Product Owner, Collaborator at SmartBear. &ldquo;The Git/Eclipse plug-in allows reviews to be quickly and easily created for the most popular SCM on the planet, while allowing developers to stay in Eclipse to participate in reviews.&rdquo;<br /><br />In 2014, Git surpassed SVN as the most widely used SCM. Collaborator always offered a Git integration as well as an Eclipse plug-in but did not support Git/Eclipse together until now. Collaborator 9.0 has also improved file upload performance by as much as 1,000 percent for large reviews.<br /><br />Collaboration among development teams is critical for better code and higher quality software. Collaborator has been allowing development, testing and management teams to work together to improve code design and quality, as well as improve agility through collaboration across functional teams and locations. Collaborator generates metrics to improve process and verify compliance, accelerates team member onboarding and enables team members to work together to catch bugs before software hits the market.<br /><br />SmartBear is hosting a webinar, &ldquo;Introducing Collaborator 9.0,&rdquo; on&nbsp;<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Thursday, February 19, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. EST</span></span>.
