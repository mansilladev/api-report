<p><a href="http://www.amercanex.com">Amercanex</a>, the first fully electronic cannabis marketplace in which participants such as cultivators, wholesale distributors and retail vendors can sell, buy, or exchange their inventories on a fully disclosed market, announced today they have selected Scanbuy QR Code technology for its product tracking systems</p>
<p>The cannabis industry is the fastest growing industry in the United States. Amercanex will extend its marketplace services to include QR Code technology, enabling industry participants to more easily meet local and global governmental product tracking and reporting mandates, as well as future regulations not yet implemented. Scanbuy&rsquo;s technology will allow companies to begin tracking measures early in the production process, creating a smooth path to compliance with state and federal reporting mandates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By integrating a highly-sophisticated QR Code technology into our marketplace offer, Amercanex members can quickly begin tracking products from initial packing through point of sale, stated Steve Janjic, Amercanex CEO. &ldquo;This advancement provides our members with additional value-added services they need to deliver amid ever-changing reporting regulations, coupled with point-of-sale services useful for educating and marketing to consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scanbuy API provides QR Code creation technology for tagging and tracking, along with analytics needed to facilitate the new process from start to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scanbuy QR Code API is being used by a variety of industries, for customer interactions, shipping returns, and now tracking and reporting for a fast growing new industry,&rdquo; stated Chai Outmezguine, Scanbuy Co-founder and Acting-CEO. &ldquo;We are confident that this technology will streamline the distribution and regulatory process for Amercanex members.&rdquo;</p>
