<p><a href="http://www.gest.co">Gest</a>, a new digital toolkit for anyone who works with their hands, launched into public beta today to add a new level of precision and speed to everyone&rsquo;s favorite applications. Using Gest, anyone can manipulate digital objects and applications using common motions and gestures, all without a mouse or keyboard. Starting today, Gest is available for pre-order on <a title="Kickstarter" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2lja3N0YXJ0ZXIuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL2FzZGZmaWxtcy84ODYwMDMzNjE/dG9rZW49NGM1ZGE3ZmQ=">Kickstarter</a> at an introductory price of $99.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Gest conforms to any hand through an adjustable palm strap and moldable finger mounts. Each controller is equipped with 15 discrete sensors per hand, giving it the ability to sense small movements with extreme precision far beyond anything else on the market. Controllers connect directly to computers using Bluetooth low energy. It is beautifully designed, light and comfortable.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The last time we saw a truly drastic change in the way people interact with technology was when Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007. We believe we&rsquo;re on the cusp of another transformative change,&rdquo; said Mike Pfister, CEO and co-founder of Apotact Labs, the creators of Gest. &ldquo;Gest was designed to help creative professionals work with their hands in a more intuitive and natural way. We built Gest on a foundation of technology that will enable it to become the de facto standard for gesture interaction. The problem is that as our devices get smaller, productivity decreases because there isn&rsquo;t an apt input method. We hope to replace the keyboard and mouse entirely for emerging augmented reality devices, enabling a truly productive and mobile computer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Once on, Gest tracks finger and hand movements to understand the meaning behind them. Gest uses machine learning and a proprietary statistical model to interpret gestures, improve accuracy and personalize the user experience. Users can then create their own custom gestures and tie them to specific actions, and share those configurations with their teams to create collaborative and productive work styles.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Today the company also announced it will be opening up its SDK to give developers the freedom to build new applications, integrations and use cases for Gest. The company will also allow access to raw sensor data in addition to custom skeletal models and motion processed data to give developers even more freedom to create. The company will initially be providing Java and Python APIs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Gest is incredibly versatile. Swipe your hand to the left to change a tab in your browser. Point at your screen to move the mouse around. Twist your palm to adjust sliders in photoshop. Manipulate objects in virtual reality. Perform 3D rotations just by grabbing and rotating with your hand. You don&rsquo;t have to think about what you&rsquo;re doing, just do it,&rdquo; said Sid Srikumar, co-founder of Apotact Labs. &ldquo;Using our SDK, Gest can be programmed to perform an infinite number of functions. We&rsquo;re beyond excited to put Gest in the hands of users and developers to see what it can truly do. The possibilities are endless.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Pre-orders will be delivered in Q4 of 2016. Out of the box, they will be compatible with Photoshop and include five pre-installed gestures for designers. Additional integrations with other creative applications will be considered based on feedback and demand from early customers.</p>
