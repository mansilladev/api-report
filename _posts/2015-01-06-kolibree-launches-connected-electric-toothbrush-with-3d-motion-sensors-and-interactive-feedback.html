<p>Today, at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Las Vegas</span>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kolibree.com/" target="_blank">Kolibree,</a>&nbsp;a company dedicated to connected innovative solutions to keep you healthy and smart, announced that they will exhibit the Kolibree connected electric toothbrush, their first commercially available product at the SANDS Convention Center all week &ndash; Booth #74737 -- and at the Showstoppers Media Event on the evening of&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">January 6</span>, at the Wynn Hotel, Booth #A1.</p>
<p>Kolibree is the only connected electric toothbrush on the market that gives you real-time feedback using its 3D sensors (9 axis), and built in accelerometer, gyrometer and magnetometer. Kolibree's proprietary technology knows whether you've effectively reached every zone of your mouth and statistically what areas you have missed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How it Works:</span></strong></p>
<p>Once you brush your teeth, feedback on how well you've brushed goes directly to your smartphone via Bluetooth and the data is stored in an individual profile &ndash; you can also store countless people's brushing habits on one smartphone, making it motivating for the whole family.</p>
<p>The data can be kept private or shared with your dentist. "What's great about the Kolibree toothbrush, for a dentist who focuses on children's dental care, is that I can see how well they're doing and can coach them on where to improve. For patients who have just had dental surgery, I can even recommend which vibration is the most effective one based on the condition of their mouth," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Holly Hasegawa</span>, DDS, MS, Co-Founder and Advisor of Kolibree.</p>
<p>The toothbrush has built in sophisticated sensors and spatial analysis which not only records where the brush is in your mouth but also understands how to collect and decipher that data so that it becomes truly useful for both users and dentists.</p>
<p>"Imagine having a GPS device in your mouth that tells you where the toothbrush has been effective and where it hasn't," said Thomas Serval, CEO and Co-Founder of Kolibree. "Unlike anything else that exists today, Kolibree gives you real time feedback so you can brush better next time. And, because the vibration is softer than most other solutions, it doesn't harm your gums, making it an ideal choice for kids and seniors alike."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interactive Apps:<br /></span></strong><em>Pirates</em>&nbsp;is the answer to the biggest challenge parents and dentists have &ndash; motivating their kids to brush for two minutes without getting bored. The game, which was developed using the open Kolibree SDK, rewards kids with coins when they brush correctly and spend enough time at each location of their mouth.&nbsp; After a series of brushings, parents and dentists have access to an interactive map showing the over and under brushed areas, data that can be used to help kids improve.</p>
<p><em>Kolibree Coach</em>&nbsp;is a brushing app that tracks brushing movement and location and alerts you of your brushing accuracy in real time using a green or red halo, all while allowing your favorite music to play in the background. It makes the once boring two minute brushing time fun and engaging. The app is the first of its kind to not only analyze the movement like many 3D motion sensors can but detect the location of the brush in your mouth. It can be customized by dentists who can coach their patients where to spend more time in neglected areas and program a lighter vibration after surgery. Rewards are given for progress and the whole family can participate and even...compete.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dentegra Collaboration<br /></span></strong>Through a collaboration with Dentegra Insurance Company, which focuses on providing affordable dental care for individuals and groups,&nbsp;users who sign up for the Dentegra Smile Club have the opportunity to purchase a Kolibree&nbsp;toothbrush&nbsp;at a significant discount and&nbsp;earn rewards and incentives for brushing properly. Once certain brushing milestones are met,&nbsp;members can earn points redeemable for a cleaning and checkup from a Dentegra network dentist. The Dentegra discount plan will not be an insurance program.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Open API<br /></span></strong>Kolibree offers an open API for iPhone and Android, which means that developers now have access to the most advanced dental tracking device on the market. The SDK also offers access to the Kolibree dental professional platform linking dentists to patients and to the rewards system, which further enhances the brushing experience.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lightweight &amp; Ergonomic<br /></span></strong>The Kolibree toothbrush is much lighter than most electric toothbrushes on the market making it an ideal choice for family use. Its smaller brush heads make it easier to navigate in tougher to reach areas of the mouth. The vibration is based on Sonic technology and is softer than many of the harsher vibrations of other brushes, making it a safer alternative for kids, seniors and those who have had surgery.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Availability:<br /></span></strong>The Kolibree connected electric toothbrush will start shipping in the U.S. this month and in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Europe</span>&nbsp;later in Q1 2015. It is priced at&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$199</span>retail. Those who sign up for the Dentegra Smile Club will receive a discount on the toothbrush and can receive discounts from Dentegra network dentists. The Dentegra Smile Club is slated for launch in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Austin</span>&nbsp;in Q1 2015.
