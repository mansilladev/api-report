<p><a href="http://www.revinate.com">Revinate</a>, the software as a service (SaaS) company that helps hotels reinvent the guest experience today announces its new interface with RoomKeyPMS, the single, integrated hotel property management system. RoomKeyPMS API integration allows customers to have an easy-to-use guest engagement platform that can be set up in a matter of hours, expediting the Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) integration and onboarding process.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With the Revinate Marketing&trade; integration, RoomKeyPMS customers can send automated guest communications via email and SMS throughout the guest stay. These include communications like pre-stay welcome emails, targeted offers while guests are on-property, and post-stay guest satisfaction surveys upon departure. Revinate is one of the only marketing automation platforms that caters exclusively to hoteliers, driving an average revenue of $4200 per promotional campaign that&rsquo;s directly attributable to email marketing.</p>
