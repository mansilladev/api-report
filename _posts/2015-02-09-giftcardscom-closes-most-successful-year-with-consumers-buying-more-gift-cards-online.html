<p><a href="http://www.giftcards.com/">GiftCards.com</a>, the leading online retailer of gift cards, today announced the sale of its 6,000,000th gift card. This milestone caps a period of phenomenal growth, innovation and noteworthy achievements in 2014.</p>
<p>The company closed a successful 2014 holiday season, bringing total annual growth to 44% over 2013. GiftCards.com attributes this growth from the fastest growing trend in the marketplace: more customers buying gift cards online than ever before and growth in egift cards.</p>
<p>According to CEB, the migration from plastic to digital has grown by 20% in 2014. GiftCards.com has more than doubled that growth, indicating it is a major benefactor of that migration.</p>
<p>In addition, the egift card business has grown by 156% up from 7.6% of sales in December 2013 to 15.1% in the same month of 2014. Part of this growth can be attributed to the recent partnership with CashStar, which enables the online portal to offer egift cards for brands like Barnes &amp; Noble, Nike, GameStop or JCPenney among dozens of others as well as direct partnerships with over 100 major brands.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;We are very bullish on 2015,&rdquo; comments Jason Wolfe, founder and CEO of GiftCards.com. &ldquo;In the past, customers would buy gift cards at grocery stores and it was hard for online companies to compete with that segment. However, with most brands offering eGift cards, and distribution costs very low online &ndash; the market is ready for the large shift to online over offline. We made a bet on gift cards moving online a few years ago and we are now benefiting from that vision. The market continues to move in our direction at an accelerated pace. In 2015 we will continue to add national brand name partners to our egift platform, we will expand our local gift card merchant base, and we will enhance our API platform for our distribution partners.&rdquo;</em></p>
