<p><a href="http://www.trans-cosmos.co.jp/english/">transcosmos inc.</a> in collaboration with social media operations support provider SOCIAL GEAR PTE LTD (hereafter, social gear), will start providing ad delivery services that enable link induction on Instagram in response to the provision of Instagram Ads API.  Services will begin on September 9 targeting seven countries (*1) overseas, and will begin in Japan on October 1.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Instagram is a social network service that retains more than 300 million active users per month throughout the world, and it has succeeded in gaining even more users since being acquired by Facebook&reg; in 2012.  In addition, more than 70% of Instagram users are in their late teens to mid-30s, a group which plays a central role in future purchasing and who desired ad delivery to Instagram from advertisers.  Now, delivery of ads utilizing Instagram Ads API will be possible within the "social gear Ads+ (patent pending)" advertising management services of social gear.  This allows advertisers to not only use images on Instagram, but also to create links (installation of call-to-action buttons), and it is also possible to utilize targeting functions such as custom audiences or similar audiences in the same way as Facebook.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As of last year, social gear was selected as an authorized partner in the "Community Management" category of Facebook Marketing Partners (formerly, Preferred Marketing Developers), and it has until now been offering advanced marketing services through insight analysis for more than 2,000 corporate Facebook pages.  "social gear Ads+" is an advertising management service that fully exploits their know-how to support digital marketing which properly utilizes insight data.  Operations similar to Facebook have also become possible in Instagram, and services will be provided which utilize the knowledge acquired up until now.  In addition, support in Japanese, English and Chinese is also available for overseas customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Through a strategic capital and business alliance with social gear, transcosmos as an exclusive agent sells the various advertising services provided by social gear.</p>
