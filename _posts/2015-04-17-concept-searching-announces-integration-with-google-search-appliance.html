<p><a href="http://www.conceptsearching.com/wp/">Concept Searching</a>, the global leader in semantic metadata generation, auto-classification, and taxonomy management software, and developer of the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25jZXB0c2VhcmNoaW5nLmNvbS93cC9zb2x1dGlvbnMvc21hcnQtY29udGVudC1mcmFtZXdvcmsv">Smart Content Framework</a>&trade;, is pleased to announce a new release of the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25jZXB0c2VhcmNoaW5nLmNvbS93cC9jb25jZXB0Y2xhc3NpZmllci1wbGF0Zm9ybS8=">conceptClassifier product platform</a>, which supports Google Search Appliance.</p>
<p>The new release of conceptClassifier was driven by customer demand, and requests to deliver the market leading metadata generation and auto-classification platform integrated with Google Search Appliance. Enterprise search is becoming a high priority in many enterprises. Organizations are now evaluating add-on tools, to improve search engine results and provide auto-classification. conceptClassifier provides the same, rich features available in all&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25jZXB0c2VhcmNoaW5nLmNvbS93cC9wcm9kdWN0cy8=">Concept Searching platforms</a>, including automatic conceptual metadata generation, auto-classification, and robust taxonomy management tools.</p>
<p>A short demonstration of the integration features and benefits can be viewed&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1DM1lTc2FKblJ4SSZmZWF0dXJlPXlvdXR1LmJl">here</a>.</p>
<p>conceptClassifier is the technology platform deployed in a non-SharePoint environment using Concept Searching&rsquo;s published APIs. The technology is used in a heterogeneous environment and the APIs supply the automatically generated semantic metadata to any search engine index, to enable concept based searching. The APIs also integrate with any other systems or applications that use metadata, such as content management systems and applications for records management, data protection, and migration.</p>
<p>The new release runs on a separate Windows server, so the classification processing has minimum impact on the Google Search Appliance indexing performance. The product extends the standard Google Search Appliance connectors with a web services call to conceptClassifier in order to insert metadata into the Google Search Appliance index. The product is designed to work with the latest, version 4 connectors. conceptClassifier supports a range of sources, including websites, file shares, and SharePoint, and there is no limitation on the number of taxonomies that can be developed. The resulting multi-term metadata is displayed in the refinement panel, where it can be used to filter search results. This enables concept based searching, as multi-term metadata representing concepts can be made available to the Google Search Appliance index.</p>
