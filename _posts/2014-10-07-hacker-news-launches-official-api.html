<p>The popular tech news aggregation site <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> just <a href="https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/">launched an API</a>, and acknowledging the appetite of its very tech savvy audience, has also ensured that the API is real-time. The <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">YCombintaor</a> backed Hacker News has partnered with real-time framework <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to launch an API layer that developer can use to consume, and engage with the Hacker News community in real-time.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/hacker-news-api">announcement for the new API</a>, HN acknowledges that they launched the API in response to there being "a lot of apps and projects out there that rely on scraping the site to access the data inside it&rdquo;, so HN decide it was "best to release a proper API and give everyone time to convert their code before we launch any new HTML&rdquo;.</p>
<p>HN chose to partner with <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> to give "developers near real-time access to our data&rdquo;, but also at the same time provide them with "well designed, easy to use SDKs for iOS, Android and the Web, in addition to a REST API&rdquo;. Serving both the needs of HN in managing their own UI evolution, but also serving the needs of their existing community.</p>
<p>You can access the real-time HN API at <a href="https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com">https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com</a>, and direct questions and feedback to <a href="mailto:api@ycombinator.com">api@ycombinator.com</a>.</p>
