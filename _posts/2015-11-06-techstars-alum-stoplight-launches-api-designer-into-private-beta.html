<p><a href="https://stoplight.io">StopLight</a>, an early leader in the nascent API Management market, has released API Designer into private beta. The company&rsquo;s powerful editor provides the fastest and most frictionless way for teams to design, manage and collaborate on APIs in real-time - enhancing productivity. Developers can visit <a href="https://stoplight.io">https://stoplight.io</a> today for early access to the API Designer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">APIs are critical to any business operating in today&rsquo;s digital environment. Every mobile app, IoT device, and web service, is made possible by API technology. StopLight&rsquo;s solution aims to eliminate wasted developer hours and bugs, improve team communication, streamline workflows, and improve the overall quality of the modern API.  Net results include better products and more satisfied teams.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Keith Casey, co-author of &ldquo;A Practical Approach to API Design&rdquo;, &ldquo;Building a house without a plan is foolish but we've done the same with APIs for years. If we put just a little thought into design, we can create APIs that work well now and into the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">API Designer&rsquo;s core features include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Collaborative discovery &amp; documentation</li>
<li> Import / export to existing API specs like Swagger</li>
<li> Validation</li>
<li> Mocking and transformations</li>
<li> A variety of simple visual interfaces</li>
<li> Prism API Proxy integration</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Developers are one of a company's most expensive resources. With API Designer&rsquo;s focus on debugging, documentation, and collaboration, we are helping development teams do more in less time, improve the quality of their APIs, and shift focus back to innovation,&rdquo; said Marc MacLeod, Founder and CEO of StopLight.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Prism, a lightweight dependency-free proxy, sits behind API Designer and enables features like API mocking, validation, and transformation. Prism makes it possible for teams to truly work independently but collaboratively, vastly increasing developer productivity and efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
