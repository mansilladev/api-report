<p><a href="http://www.maintenanceassistant.com/">Maintenance Assistant</a> is pleased to announce the beta release of Maintenance Assistant for Google Glass&trade;. Maintenance Assistant for Glass is the latest release in a series of disruptive technologies that have been built to showcase the many integration points with its industry-leading cloud platform for maintenance and asset management.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;In an industry that&rsquo;s typically a late adopter of technology and plagued by bloated, outdated software, we believe in the importance of challenging the status quo and building software that&rsquo;s more forward thinking. We wanted to demonstrate the power of our modern cloud platform by allowing Glass to access our maintenance software, and decided to make it a reality this summer&rdquo;, said Marc Castel, CEO.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using Google Glass&trade;, a wifi enabled pair of glasses with a heads-up display, users of Maintenance Assistant&rsquo;s maintenance software can walk through their factory, scan equipment and instantly check on the status of equipment &ndash; including current meter readings, outstanding work orders and scheduled maintenance items -  or easily add a new piece of equipment to the maintenance system through voice commands to Google Glass&trade;. The practical benefit of Maintenance Assistant for Glass is that it is portable, and wearable, allowing hands-free access to equipment information while technicians perform their maintenance in the field.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The integration of Glass with Maintenance Assistant is just one of many progressive beta projects we&rsquo;ve been working on at MA Labs using our API,&rdquo; said Daryl Sedgman, CTO. &ldquo;From the beginning, Maintenance Assistant has aimed to disrupt the maintenance industry by providing it with the cutting-edge technology it deserves. Integrating with Google Glass&trade; demonstrates another step in that direction alongside our other recent integrations with Arduino and Raspberry Pi mini-computers.&rdquo;</p>
