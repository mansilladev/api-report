The deal combines Inaccess expertise in operation, performance and fault management remote monitoring solutions with Maintenance Assistant&rsquo;s expertise in multi-tenant cloud CMMS software.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This strategic partnership with Maintenance Assistant demonstrates our commitment to innovation and technology leadership. Our company constantly strives to excel in order to fulfill our customers and partners needs, in a fully integrated approach&rdquo;, said Christos Georgopoulos, CEO Inaccess. &ldquo;Through this partnership, we can deliver a fully integrated, optimized and cost effective solar plant maintenance management solution, differentiating our product portfolio and providing added value for our customers.&rdquo; This new technology promises to redefine best-in-class maintenance at solar plants around the world.

<p>Daryl Sedgman, Chief Technology Officer at Maintenance Assistant commented: &ldquo;The growth of the Internet of Things has opened up a whole new world of innovation and connectivity.

Working with Inaccess to develop an integrated solar management solution is another exciting milestone for us, as we continue our aggressive advance into the IOT, the cloud, and beyond.&rdquo; The ongoing strategic partnership with Inaccess demonstrates the power and flexibility of the&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="MA Connect API" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFpbnRlbmFuY2Vhc3Npc3RhbnQuY29tL2NtbXMvbWEtY29ubmVjdC8=">MA Connect API</a>&nbsp;while delivering enormous value to both new and existing Inaccess and Maintenance Assistant customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our multi-tenant, highly scalable, cloud-based architecture enables Maintenance Assistant to be a technology enablement platform for customers and partners like Inaccess&rdquo; said James Novak, COO. &ldquo;In addition to the integration of the solutions, Inaccess will also distribute the co-branded MA CMMS Platform to their customers. This represents a major differentiator for Maintenance Assistant as we expand distribution of our platform with strategic partners into new vertical markets and geographic areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monitoring and control system of Inaccess is an integrated, vendor independent solution for the centralized management of geographically distributed solar plants and telecom sites. Offering accurate fault recognition and real-time performance monitoring, it guarantees smooth operation and maximizes performance. The system continuously monitors the supervised equipment to detect operation failures or under-performance spots. With MA CMMS integration, Inaccess offers a complete end-to-end operation and maintenance solution. If any system fails, the machine health data is sent to the CMMS where work orders are automatically triggered and assigned to the appropriate mechanics. This eliminates the human element in both recording meters and scheduling maintenance, ensuring critical maintenance happens on time, and before the issue turns into something more serious. Directly accessing live machine data will help improve maintenance response times, reduce downtime and eliminate inefficiencies. A fully productive installation ultimately drives more money to the bottom line. The full holistic solution is sure to be the envy of any managed asset&rsquo;s owner or operator.</p>
