<p><a href="http://hostmeapp.com">Restaurant services vendor HostMe, LLC </a>announced today the complete product launch of HostMe, a modern, customizable front-of-house system that is already revolutionizing the way restaurants do business.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to truly bring restaurant management into the digital era,&rdquo; said co-founder Evgeny Popov. &ldquo;Where other vendors have stopped short of full integration, the HostMe app and hardware bundle offers restaurateurs the opportunity to improve front-of-house operations by transitioning the business away from cumbersome pager systems and toward a tablet- and app-based experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">HostMe partnered with Heckler Design to create its hardware bundle, which includes a tablet, as well as a high-end &ldquo;WindFall&rdquo; stand and cable lock. &ldquo;Restaurant goers, restaurant owners, and the creators of HostMe all have high standards and demand the very best experiences,&rdquo; said Dean Heckler, founder and lead designer of Heckler Design. &ldquo;The fact that these folks have unanimously selected WindFall hardware by Heckler Design is a great compliment. By working seamlessly together, restaurant owners can give their customers a streamlined, more interactive and aesthetically pleasing check-in experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The package is powered by the HostMe app, which combines reservation, wait list, and loyalty program management into one easy-to-use product. An open-platform service allows for API integration, meaning owners and operators can easily merge HostMe&rsquo;s features with existing corporate applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The complete HostMe product line is now available for purchase. For more information visit our website or email contact(at)hostmeapp(dot)com</p>
