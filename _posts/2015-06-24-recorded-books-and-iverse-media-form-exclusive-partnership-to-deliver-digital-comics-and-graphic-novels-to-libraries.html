<p class="responsiveNews">In an exclusive partnership, <a href="http://www.recordedbooks.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=rb.home">Recorded Books</a> and <a href="http://iversemedia.com/2014/">iVerse Media</a> will offer libraries and their patrons access to a selection of more than 10,000 digital comics, graphic novels and manga titles both inside the library and remotely.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This partnership gives Recorded Books&rsquo; international sales team the exclusive right to sell Comics Plus: Library Edition (CP:LE) to public libraries in the United States and Canada. The Comics Plus product allows libraries to make the most diverse and unique content available to their patrons. As a result of this new partnership, libraries will have the flexibility to offer these titles either in a traditional desktop environment or via a mobile application for smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Traditionally, comic books have been a staple in the lives of many children and the recent surge in the popularity of manga and graphic novels has raised the popularity of the genre to new heights,&rdquo; said Rich Freese, Recorded Books CEO. &ldquo;By using cutting-edge streaming and mobile technology, our new Comics Plus service will help librarians meet the growing demand for this genre in a very cost efficient way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The service utilizes the new AccessILS platform, developed by industry-leading mobile platform-as-a-service provider Boopsie to dramatically reduce the cost and time associated with developing application program interfaces (APIs) to integrate the Comics Plus catalog.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Digital comics and graphic novels are among the highest circulating segments of a library&rsquo;s collection, and the iVerse desktop digital catalog was already an attractive option to many libraries,&rdquo; said Tony Hobdy, iVerse COO. &ldquo;iVerse&rsquo;s digital catalog has the best selection of digital content, and Recorded Books&rsquo; experienced sales team is world class and knows the needs of their libraries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Recorded Books will demonstrate the new Comics Plus platform at the American Libraries Association conference in San Francisco, CA, June 26 through June 30, and invites librarians to stop by the Recorded Books booth to learn more about this fantastic new service.</p>
