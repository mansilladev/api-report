<p><a href="http://www.talentanalytics.com/">Talent Analytics,</a> Corp. today announced pre-hire flight risk predictions, for job candidates, as well as current employees. This functionality is immediately available in their award winning, predictive cloud platform, Advisor&trade; and as a feed into HCM, ATS, HRIS, LMS and other workforce systems.</p>
<p>Most of today&rsquo;s flight risk solutions target existing employees and have a goal of developing a remedy to retain a potentially disengaged employee. Talent Analytics, Corp. advances to the next level, predicting flight risk before the individual has even been hired.  Pre-hire predictions avoid the cost and expense of employees that leave after being hired, trained and brought up to speed only to leave prematurely before delivering value to their organization.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, VP &amp; Principal Analyst at Constellation Research notes "the predictive workforce analytics market is rapidly evolving. Predicting flight risk, pre-hire, is bold and exciting. It shows the ongoing and rapid advancement of predictive solutions in the workforce market."</p>
<p>As predictive analytics experts, Talent Analytics, Corp. learns from the most advanced predictive domains like predicting customer flight risk. While predicting customer flight risk was step one, more advanced predictions now identify long term, high value customers. Talent Analytics, Corp. uses the same algorithms, approaches and methodologies as these advanced predictive areas to identify long term, high value employees, pre-hire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The optimal time to predict flight risk is before you hire someone,&rdquo; says Jean Paul Isson, Global VP Predictive Analytics &amp; BI at Monster Worldwide, Inc. and author of Win With Advanced Business Analytics. &ldquo;Knowing one job candidate is three times more likely to leave within a year vs. another adds critical data to the hiring decision. With this added capability, Talent Analytics again advances how predictive analytics delivers real value to businesses and the workforce industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to deliver predictive workforce analytics solutions that target the most costly workforce-related business challenges. Pre-hire flight risk predictions deliver exponential business ROI over post-hire predictions,&rdquo; says Greta Roberts, CEO of Talent Analytics, Corp.</p>
