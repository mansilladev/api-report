<p><a href="http://connectionsforum.com/xapi-camp-seattle/">Riptide Elements is a partner sponsor for xAPI Camp that is being held on July 27th in Seattle, Washington</a>. The one-day event hosted by Amazon draws in leaders and vendors in the learning products and xAPI field.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The xAPI Camp format partners with different organizations to bridge the gaps for practitioners between learning, education, design, data, and technology. This community of technologists shares successes and challenges while working with xAPI. Riptide is a member of the workgroup that created xAPI and continues to contribute open source to the community with resources at TRYxAPI.com</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;It is super exciting and it makes sense that Amazon is getting interested in xAPI. We are looking forward to our break out session. Riptide Elements is an enterprise product and we use AWS/CDN as our managed infrastructure to deliver Elements services all over the globe.&rdquo; Nick Washburn Director of Learning stated.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Riptide Elements is a partner sponsor of the event and will be conducting a session discussing their client case studies, and use case of AWS and xAPI regarding enterprise integrations, horizontal scale, and security.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About Connections Forum </strong><br />Connections Forum illustrates what&rsquo;s possible with xAPI by conducting xAPI Camps. The origins are in an open source effort called the Experience API (xAPI). It&rsquo;s more than a learning technology. xAPI&rsquo;s utility goes beyond learning, education and training. It enables something bigger.</p>
