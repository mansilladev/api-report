<p>LSR, a global leader in wireless modules and services, announces the new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lsr.com/embedded-wireless-modules/bluetooth-module/sable-x-ble-module">SaBLE-x&trade; &nbsp;Bluetooth&reg; Smart module</a>, providing the first certified modular solution based on the recently announced&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ti.com/ep-con-lprf-slulplaunch-pr-lp-cc2640-lsr-en" target="_blank">SimpleLink&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Smart CC2640 wireless microcontroller (MCU)</a>&nbsp;from Texas Instruments (TI).&nbsp;Taking full advantage of this innovative technology from TI, the SaBLE-x module offers superior RF performance for Bluetooth low energy applications.&nbsp;The module delivers an impressive 8 dB increase in link margin when compared to LSR's previous Bluetooth low energy module offering, translating to twice the potential signal range. Further, this next-generation module offers outstanding power performance, drawing nearly two-thirds less average power for a one-second Bluetooth connection interval when compared to previous Bluetooth Smart modules.</p>
<p>"The SimpleLink CC2640 wireless MCU is the lowest power, most integrated Bluetooth Smart solution on the market allowing customers to easily add Bluetooth low energy to their project," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Amit Hammer</span>, product line manager, Wireless Connectivity Solutions, TI. "With the new SaBLE-x module from LSR, customers can quickly get started and go to production faster with hardware, software and services for their products."</p>
<p>In addition to the industry-leading RF performance of the SaBLE-x hardware, Bluetooth Smart developers will be able to access an unmatched suite of intuitive, powerful software tools built to remove complexity and accelerate development times.&nbsp; In addition, software features enable the SaBLE-x to be utilized in either a wireless MCU or wireless network processor mode.&nbsp; Network processor mode will offer dramatically simplified host interface communications through a JSON-based API, called&nbsp;<strong>TiWiConnect LIFT for BLE</strong>, as well as sample code for most common host processors.&nbsp; Another software tool, LSR's&nbsp;<strong>LIFT BLE Profile Designer</strong>, is a web-based GUI tool that will allow a developer to quickly define a custom Bluetooth profile and then auto-generate the firmware code needed by the host processor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Having spent the past 30 years helping our customers design and implement wireless technologies, we have a unique insight into how a certified Bluetooth Smart module can address their design challenges," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Dave Burleton</span>, LSR's VP of Marketing. "Adding Bluetooth Smart connectivity to a product is a complex engineering effort, and this new module, along with the powerful software suite of development tools and array of out-of-the-box certifications that are included, truly offers the simplest solution to integrate Bluetooth low energy into your product."</p>
<p>LSR, well established as a leading provider of certified&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lsr.com/embedded-wireless-modules" target="_blank">wireless modules</a>, will offer SaBLE-x with the industry's broadest array of out-of-the-box certifications for a Bluetooth Smart module.&nbsp;The SaBLE-x will include certification compliance with the FCC, Industry Canada, CE, Giteki, and C-Tick regulatory bodies, as well as qualification with the Bluetooth SIG.&nbsp; Going even further, the module certifications will feature no less than four pre-certified antenna options, and LSR will offer to add additional custom antennas to the certification at little to no cost to the customer.</p>
<p>Later this year, SaBLE-x will become the first Bluetooth Smart module featuring a pre-integrated cloud agent for the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lsr.com/embedded-wireless-modules/tiwiconnect" target="_blank">TiWiConnect&trade; Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform</a>.&nbsp;TiWiConnect is the first true end-to-end IoT solution for wirelessly connecting products to the cloud, giving products internet connectivity that can re-define the product experience for both customers and service professionals alike.</p>
<p>The SaBLE-x Bluetooth Smart module, along with a development kit featuring companion iOS and Android mobile apps, will be commercially available in the second quarter of 2015. LSR will begin working with select customers immediately to successfully design the SaBLE-x into their Bluetooth Smart product applications.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
