<p>Nationwide Inspection Company, <a href="https://www.wegolook.com/">WeGoLook</a> has recently expanded solutions for enterprise clients to utilize real estate inspections and auto inspections. WeGoLook develops customized reports and processes to allow implementation across a broad range of uses from pre-funding real estate inspections for financial institutions to post-accident auto inspections for insurance companies.</p>
<p>WeGoLook dispatches a local agent (Looker) to the on-site location of the vehicle or property. The Looker completes an inspection via the WeGoLook Mobile App by taking photos, videos, and collecting customized data. The information is then sent back to WeGoLook Headquarters for quality assurance and complied into the completed WeGoLook Report in a preferred delivery method for the client (API, .html, PDF, compressed images, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition to real estate and auto inspections, WeGoLook can be dispatched to complete an array of inspection solutions and custom tasking from courier and shipping services, document research, heavy equipment inspections, and corporate fleet verifications. The company provides rapid implementation for field services with their SSAE 16 Type II data security audit ensuring protection of privileged information.</p>
<p>The company recently launched the WeGoLook Mobile Application which allows Agents (Lookers) the ability to complete inspections entirely through their iPhone or Android devices. Lookers are able to take photos and collect on-site data within the app. The proprietary app provides clients with a secure solution, geotagging and time/date stamping photos and data.</p>
<p>WeGoLook is a dynamic field services and inspection company leveraging a sharing economy of 15,000+ Agents in the United States. Tasks and inspections are assigned to Agents through a crowdsourced platform. Agents collect field data, photos, and video via the WeGoLook Mobile App and complete custom tasking such as item pickup and delivery and more. WeGoLook specializes in verifying autos, properties, boats, heavy equipment, antiques, electronics, furniture, RV&rsquo;s and other assets. WeGoLook has expanded to international markets in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia with other countries to follow.</p>
