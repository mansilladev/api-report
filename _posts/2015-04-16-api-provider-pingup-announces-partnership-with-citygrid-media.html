<p><a href="http://pingup.com/">Pingup</a>,&nbsp;provider of the industry&rsquo;s first API that enables directories, search providers and social platforms to easily add booking capabilities to business listings on mobile and desktop, today announced a partnership with CityGrid Media for publishing on their owned and operated networks Citysearch and InsiderPages.com. CityGrid Media is partnering with the Pingup platform to equip its local listings with real-time booking capabilities within its web-based and mobile interfaces. CityGrid Media end-users will be able to book a service or schedule an appointment &ndash; at hair and beauty salons, health and wellness centers, fitness clubs, auto mechanic shops, etc.</p>
<p>By adding a &ldquo;book now&rdquo; button to existing business listings, consumers have the ease and flexibility of scheduling appointments anytime and from anywhere, without having to worry about calling a business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pingup is the only platform of its kind that&rsquo;s focused on aggregating all online schedulers in a unified digital marketplace, and that&rsquo;s very important to our business model,&rdquo; said Aaron Bush, VP Business Development at CityGrid Media. &ldquo;With Pingup&rsquo;s seamless &lsquo;plug and play&rsquo; integration we&rsquo;re opening up the possibility for the end-users in our network to make appointments with local businesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By partnering with Pingup, CityGrid Media will have access to the myriad of online schedulers that exist within the Pingup network today. For CityGrid Media end-users, the integrated experience will enable task completion &ndash; a convenience that consumers have come to expect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We solve a huge fragmentation challenge by seamlessly aggregating the real-time booking availability of top scheduling software providers into one API and we&rsquo;re thrilled CityGrid Media is extending that capability to its users,&rdquo; said Mark Slater, CEO, Pingup. &ldquo;The partnership with CityGrid Media serves as validation that there is a real need for our platform in the marketplace and that need will only continue to grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Pingup, this move is the first in a series of six major publisher partnerships planned for 2015 aimed at offering consumers more options to transact directly with businesses on publisher pages.</p>
