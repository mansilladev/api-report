<p>Maintenance Assistant Inc, a leading provider of cloud-based maintenance management software, announces another year of record growth and customer acquisition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since our launch in 2007,&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="Maintenance Assistant" href="https://www.maintenanceassistant.com/">Maintenance Assistant</a>&nbsp;(MA) has emerged as one of the fastest growing asset management and computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) providers,&rdquo; said Marc Castel, CEO. &ldquo;Our success in 2014 is a result of our decision to move away from our original on-premises software three years ago, and fully adopt the cloud. The annual growth of our cloud user base has been consistently well over 50%, with annual revenue growth in excess of 100% for a third straight year. In the past year alone we added thousands of new cloud-users to the platform from industries across the globe spanning wind energy, oil &amp; gas, automotive, medical devices, facility management and healthcare, as they recognized that our cloud solution eliminated the headaches associated with costly legacy systems that require hardware investment, constant upgrading, and significant IT resources. Our continued investment in our multi-tenant cloud infrastructure has enabled us to build more innovative and sophisticated solutions that no one could have imagined three years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While older and more traditional&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="CMMS" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWludGVuYW5jZWFzc2lzdGFudC5jb20vY21tcy8=">CMMS</a>&nbsp;providers were focusing on extending the life of their legacy on-premises technologies, Maintenance Assistant focused on the cloud, embracing innovation, new feature development and technology infrastructure improvements,&rdquo; said James Novak, COO. &ldquo;In 2014 we had over 50 product releases consistently improving and adding features to our software-as-a-service CMMS platform. In addition, with the launch of our Enterprise Tier, we made major strides in addressing the needs of larger Enterprises, bringing the cloud to a whole new class of customer. As a metrics-driven company, we were able to leverage our data to help us make smart decisions around which features mattered and what we should be building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The response has been tremendous," added Don Scraper, VP of Sales. "We&rsquo;ve now converged on a killer feature set for larger customers looking for a modern mobile and cloud-based Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) solution, while adding powerful and easily managed features to our existing clients."</p>
<p>One of the major strategic milestones reached in 2014 was the release of MA Connect&trade; API and suite of development tools.&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="MA Connect" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWludGVuYW5jZWFzc2lzdGFudC5jb20vY21tcy9tYS1jb25uZWN0Lw==">MA Connect</a>&trade; gives organizations the ability to connect their MA CMMS&trade; application to any hardware device or software application through the cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's game changing technology, facilitating real-time transfer of data between our maintenance platform and other software applications or Internet connected devices,&rdquo; said Daryl Sedgman, Chief Technology Officer. "We architected our API with accessibility and security at the forefront, leveraged by several first class client Software Developer Kits (SDKs). This way, developers have a familiar environment to build their own innovative CMMS solutions sitting on our robust CMMS platform. Since its release, the majority of our customers have decided to purchase&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="Enterprise Tier" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWludGVuYW5jZWFzc2lzdGFudC5jb20vY21tcy9wcmljaW5nLWNvbXBhcmlzb24v">tiers that include MA Connect</a>&trade; to move forward with their own direct integration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mobile workforce is a global reality which the company fully recognized and embraced in 2014. Last August, Maintenance Assistant retired its mobile web-interface and unveiled its new&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="MA Mobile CMMS" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWludGVuYW5jZWFzc2lzdGFudC5jb20vY21tcy9tb2JpbGUtY21tcy8=">native mobile app</a>&nbsp;for iOS and Android, built on the MA Connect&trade; API platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new app was designed to take full advantage of smartphone technology, utilizing the camera, barcode and QR code scanning capability, voice to text, GPS, on-board storage and the like to maximize field-worker productivity and minimize repair time. Now technicians have all the information they need while in the field to get the job done, such as procedures, repair history, and schematics, while companies can be confident that their data is fully secure,&rdquo; said Sedgman. The mobile app is available free to new and existing MA CMMS&trade; users on both the Apple or Google Play app stores. &ldquo;Mobile adoption among our customers is steadily growing and we expect this to accelerate as we bring our mobile app up to par with our desktop version in early 2015.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outlook for 2015</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal in 2015 is to continue growing our core markets, while we aggressively improve our capabilities to address larger market opportunities&rdquo;, commented James Novak, COO. &ldquo;Our focus will be on delivering more innovative and creative solutions to solve some of the industry&rsquo;s most pressing maintenance challenges, like managing MRO and spare parts spend and increasing production capacity. Our Sales and Marketing capabilities were significantly increased in 2014 and we plan on doubling down in these areas in 2015. Establishing additional partnerships with Solution Providers, OEM&rsquo;s, and&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="MRO" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWludGVuYW5jZWFzc2lzdGFudC5jb20vZWFtL21yby8=">MRO</a>&nbsp;suppliers who can harness our Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) will also be a priority, and will allow them to leverage the interconnectivity between their systems and offerings and our cloud-based CMMS users.&rdquo;</p>
