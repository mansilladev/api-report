<p>OKIDOKEYS opened its Smart Application today for integrators and developers to build smart lock connectivity into their home automation platforms and connected devices. OKIDOKEYS Open API can be interfaced with an external device or system, such as a smartphone app, or a home automation hub. Developers can manage all account operations with it making their apps and platforms more powerful and increased functionality. Developers will be allowed to display the "Works with OKIDOKEYS" image to promote their expanded power and functionality.</p>
<p>"Collaboration and interconnectivity is what will make the Internet of Things (IoT) a reality for the average user," says&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Pascal Metivier</span>, founder and CEO of OpenWays and OKIDOKEYS. "So many developers have fantastic ideas for creating innovative software solutions for the people who use our Smart-Locks, and we want to make it as easy as possible for them to make their concepts a reality."</p>
<p>Designed by a team with over 100 years of combined experience in delivering proven, high quality security solutions for the access control and hotel industry worldwide, the OKIDOKEYS Smart-Lock is made to enhance your existing deadbolt. It installs easily in just a few minutes on the interior of your front door without drilling or wiring. Once the Smart-Lock is installed, you can lock and unlock your doors using your smartphone, thanks to the free OKIDOKEYS app available for Apple iOS and Android. Select from six opening rules to fit your needs, including a hands-free mode. In addition, your metal keys continue to operate as before.</p>
<p>The OKIDOKEYS app and web portal allow you to create, share and revoke access for family, friends and third parties such as babysitters and trusted service people, and receive notifications when doors are being operated. Smart Keys may be created with date and time limits. OKIDOKEYS are the perfect solution for rental units and home-sharing, giving property owners affordable peace of mind.</p>
