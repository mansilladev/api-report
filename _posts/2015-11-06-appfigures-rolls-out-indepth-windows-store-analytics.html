<p><a href="https://appfigures.com/">appFigures</a>, the app store intelligence platform that helps businesses and developers make better data-driven decisions, today announced the launch of Windows Store performance analytics for all users. The launch provides access to necessary Windows app store performance insights, including downloads, revenue, and returns for apps and in-app purchases &ndash; all along-side the same data for apps sold through other stores like the iOS App Store and Google Play. A beta version of Windows Store analytics were previously available to select appFigures customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Data-driven decision-making requires having a complete picture of your portfolio's performance,&rdquo; said Ariel Michaeli, co-founder and CEO of appFigures. &ldquo;By including Windows Store analytics in appFigures, businesses and developers now have access to sales and downloads data for their apps across all major app stores &ndash; and all in one place. This is a necessity for anyone with different points of app distribution and monetization.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">appFigures is a powerful app store intelligence platform that helps its users effectively monitor, measure and evaluate app store performance. The platform provides comprehensive reports on app store success, with metrics on downloads, revenue, ranks, reviews, and more, in near real-time. In doing so, appFigures enables actionable insights for app creators, empowering them to make better, data-driven decisions to enhance mobile app engagement, app store performance and revenue.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">More than one billion Windows 10-enabled devices are expected to be sold within the next two to three years. To drive adoption of Windows 10 via apps, Microsoft continues to invest in the Windows Store for developers, building a better all-around experience to encourage quality app creation. In addition to unifying Windows Phone Store (mobile apps) and Windows Store (desktop), bringing all apps under one roof as the Windows Store, Microsoft also recently launched developer tools to simplify cross-device application development for Windows 10.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Microsoft made a bold move, connecting its app stores for desktop and phone together,&rdquo; added Michaeli. &ldquo;Microsoft has been aiming for a single experience that crosses mobile, tablet, and desktop since the release of Windows 10, and a single app store makes the most sense. To developers, this means a larger and healthier ecosystem that includes a massive number of devices and even greater  revenue potential.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With the launch of Windows Store analytics, appFigures continues to provide app makers with a comprehensive list of integrations that includes all major app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play, Amazon Appstore and Windows) and over 20 unique ad networks, such as Apple&rsquo;s iAd and Google&rsquo;s Admob.</p>
