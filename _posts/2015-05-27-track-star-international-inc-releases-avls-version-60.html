<p><a href="https://www.trackstar.com/">Track Star International, Inc.</a> is pleased to announce the release of Version 6.0 of the Automatic Vehicle Location System (AVLS) software product.</p>
<p>This important new version of the Track Star AVLS system provides customers with an impressive array of important new features and capabilities.  While retaining the long standing affordable, private, powerful and flexible hallmarks of the AVLS system, Version 6.0 provides a new capability that offers web browser based access to the system in addition to the traditional thick client software.</p>
<p>By using state of the art software development tools and techniques, Track Star has been successful in crafting a browser based user interface to the system that can be accessed by virtually any device with a web browser without requiring an &ldquo;app&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Beyond this important new capability, Track Star has taken full advantage of advanced technologies related to computer generated mapping and now offers the ability to overlay map data such as weather onto the user display dramatically increasing the situational knowledge for dispatchers, fleet administrators and other users.</p>
<p>Version 6.0 also introduces a work order function that allows users, through the use of an Application Programming Interface (API), to integrate other systems in the organization so that locations where workers are needed are displayed on the map along with vehicle location and status.</p>
<p>All Track Star customers receive this important new release either directly or through their Authorized Track Star dealer.
