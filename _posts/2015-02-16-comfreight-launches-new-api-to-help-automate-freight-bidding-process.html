<p>The Freight Marketplace, <a href="https://comfreight.com/">Load Board</a>&nbsp;and Rate Index Web App called ComFreight has just released their new API for shippers, carriers and freight brokers. The recent release is also coordinated with other features and tools set to be released on the platform in 2015 to help automate the freight bidding and truck loading process for companies operating in the logistics and trucking industries.</p>
<p>The new API helps to automatically interface with other TMS (Transportation Management Systems), WMS (Warehouse Management Systems) and Order Management Systems to help commercial shippers automatically post&nbsp;available freight loads&nbsp;to the ComFreight platform and web application. By automatically posting loads when they become available from Shippers and Brokers, the API is able to help eliminate a large chunk of time usually spent performing data entry in two or three systems. Now any shipper or broker can request and API key from ComFreight's support team and be up and auto-posting their RFPs for freight moves in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>This is good news for trucking companies also, because the API can easily be configured to accept or automatically post available empty partial truck/trailer space or full empty trucking capacity allowing for faster and easier matching to available loads on the web as well. Once an integration is completed, the empty truck space can be posted to ComFreight via the API automatically and then matching loads within range of the available truck will be sent as possible matching options via email alerts and push notifications to the trucking company in real time.</p>
<p>"We are working to make the process of receiving competing bids and filling extra available trailer space in commercial trucking easier and less time consuming by offering automated solutions for matching data that our users and clients already have in their own systems," said Steve Kochan, CEO at ComFreight.</p>
<p>"Saving time and money for our users continues to be our core focus with our continued product development and we're excited to announce further updates to improve the automated data sharing like this will be coming in the near future as well," Kochan also said.</p>
<p>Integration with ComFreight via their API is free so there are no setup charges or additional fees required to start working with their new automated posting API or to setup an integration.</p>
