<p><a href="http://www.liaison.com/">Liaison Technologies</a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liaison.com/" target="_blank">,</a>&nbsp;the industry-recognized leader in cloud-based integration and data management offerings, today announced the availability of the&nbsp;Liaison Alloy Platform, the industry's first dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service) solution.</p>
<p>Platform as a Service is a powerful, liberating concept that provides superior economics, improved productivity and agility, and more control to enterprises when compared to the traditional software and Software as a Service (SaaS) options. Liaison's new Alloy Platform&trade; delivers these benefits where companies need freedom and flexibility the most: close to their business, close to their data.</p>
<p>The Alloy Platform, combined with Liaison's deep integration expertise, uniquely and comprehensively solves the challenges that older technologies such as ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) and the more recent productivity tools focused point integration solutions such iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) fail to address. Using Liaison's cloud-based dPaaS platform, integration tasks are addressed in a managed services environment, thereby freeing company experts to focus on deriving real world insights from their data that is securely stored on and made accessible by the Alloy Platform. No longer will developers, data scientists and engineers be relegated to being the equivalent of technical janitors by laboring to acquire, harmonize and securely store data. Liaison's Alloy Platform puts businesses in control of their data with open API's and advanced data management capabilities.</p>
<p>"The introduction of a dedicated dPaaS such as Liaison Alloy is a breath of fresh air," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Brad Shimmin</span>, Service Director for Business Technology and Software at Current Analysis. "Too many solutions are delivering point answers or limited-scale capabilities that are not up to the massive challenges that lie ahead for an industry increasingly driven by data. With over 15 years of experience in managing data in the cloud, Liaison's unified architecture for data integration and data management is well positioned to tackle the growing data demands and complexities associated with this emerging market opportunity."</p>
<p>"Liaison has invested over three years of engineering to create the Alloy Platform," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Bob Renner</span>, CEO of Liaison Technologies. "Leveraging well over a decade of experience serving 7000+ customers from a cloud platform and being in the front lines of today's data challenges, we felt empowered to take the bold direction of launching industry's first dPaaS solution. Our customers will now have a fully managed integration solution combined with a flexible and fully accessible data management platform.
