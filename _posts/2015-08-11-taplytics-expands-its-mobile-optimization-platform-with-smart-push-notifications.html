<p><a href="http://www.taplytics.com">Taplytics</a> announced today that it&rsquo;s broadening its mobile optimization platform with a new Smart Push service for companies to optimize all aspects of their mobile push notification campaigns. Taplytics is now the only company to tightly integrate all of the tools that companies need to create engaging mobile experiences &ndash; from A/B testing to precise personalization to results-driven analytics.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using the new Smart Push service, companies can easily A/B test the messages, delivery times and other variants of their push campaigns on Android and iOS devices, including wearables. Taplytics&rsquo; mobile analytics then shows them exactly which campaign elements are working and which need to be adjusted to spark engagement.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Deep segmentation capabilities allow the push notification messages to be hyper-personalized &ndash; even down to the individual. Additionally, the notifications can be customized based on any combination of user data and in-app interactions, such as browsing activity and previous purchases. This tailored approach helps build a more personal and loyal relationship with the customer and enhances their app experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Push notifications are one of the most effective strategies to continually engage users with your app and your brand, but they&rsquo;ll backfire 100 percent of the time if they&rsquo;re generic and untargeted,&rdquo; said Aaron Glazer, CEO of Taplytics. &ldquo;We help companies determine who they should send push notifications to based on user behavior, so each one is contextually relevant and creates an engaging, personalized mobile experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">How Smart Push Works <br />Marketers, product managers and other non-developers can design and preview their push notification campaigns using Taplytics&rsquo; intuitive Visual Editor, and then test unlimited variations of them with users who have downloaded their app. Results-driven analytics provide guidance on optimal timing and frequency, and show how the campaigns are affecting a company&rsquo;s bottom-line. Everyday push notifications can be easily triggered using Taplytics&rsquo; API, and others can be scheduled ahead of time to coincide with sales, promotions, product updates or other major events.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The nirvana for mobile marketers is creating that magical moment for shoppers or subscribers where you&rsquo;re presenting the right message at the right time and making it all work,&rdquo; said Glazer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving them all of the information they need to reach that moment quicker than their competitors and start reaping real ROI.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">First Full Platform Integration <br />Taplytics built its mobile-first platform from the ground up, and is the only company to tightly integrate all of its mobile optimization tools. This allows users to port their web data, mobile data and all of the actions within that data into the platform, and to draw on those combined insights to create different and optimized customer app experiences.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Marketing mobile apps is a tall enough task on its own, and it&rsquo;s exponentially harder when you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish all of these various functions using disparate tools and data sets,&rdquo; said Glazer. &ldquo;We put our users&rsquo; needs and challenges above all else when developing this platform, which meant making it exceedingly functional and simple at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Taplytics&rsquo; mobile optimization platform, including the Smart Push service, is now available on a subscription basis. Free trials are available for first-time users.</p>
