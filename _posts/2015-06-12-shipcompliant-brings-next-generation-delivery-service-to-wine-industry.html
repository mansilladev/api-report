<p><a href="http://www.shipcompliant.com"> ShipCompliant</a> has partnered with Doorman &mdash;The Evening On Demand Delivery Service to give its winery clients a full proof way of assuring direct to consumer deliveries are never missed again. With NakedWines.com as the first ShipCompliant partner offer the service, the winery may now promise online customers that their wine will arrive within a 2-hour delivery window.</p>
<p>ShipCompliant expects to offer all its winery clients access to the Doorman service in July.</p>
<p>Doorman eliminates the expensive and inconvenient problem of missed wine deliveries. With Doorman integrated into online winery websites via the ShipCompliant compliance platform, consumers specify exactly when they want the wine delivered to their home or office from the Doorman warehouse, eliminating the problem of not being home to sign for the wine.  The service is currently available only in San Francisco. The Doorman delivery service has plans to expand to Chicago and New York soon.</p>
<p>"Our data shows that 20% of packages are not successfully delivered to residential addresses on the first try,&rdquo; said Jason Eckenroth, ShipCompliant founder and CEO. &ldquo;This is expensive for wineries and frustrating for customers. Our hope is that with this partnership we can dramatically improve the experience for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Integrating Doorman via the ShipCompliant API, NakedWines.com is now able to offer customer-selected evening delivery windows to San Francisco customers. Doorman will deliver NakedWines.com packages to residences during an evening time slot requested by the customer (between 6:00 and 8:00pm, 8:00 and 10:00pm or 10:00pm and 12:00am). With its July rollout to all its winery clients, ShipCompliant will make it easy for wineries to use Doorman&rsquo;s delivery service, while also providing package tracking and customer delivery analysis for every package.</p>
