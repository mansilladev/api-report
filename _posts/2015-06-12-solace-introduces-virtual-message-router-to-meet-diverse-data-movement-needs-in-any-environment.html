<p><a href="http://solacesystems.com">Solace Systems</a> today announced the <a href="http://www.solacesystems.com/products">Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR)</a>, a version of its market-leading SolOS messaging middleware platform that runs on commodity hardware instead of the company&rsquo;s purpose-built appliances. The VMR lets customers deploy Solace&rsquo;s data movement solution into virtually any environment, while the Solace 3530 and Solace 3560 appliances address requirements best met with dedicated hardware in datacenters.</p>
<p>Horizontal trends like big data, cloud computing and the Internet of Things, along with industry trends like Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in the telecom sector, are introducing the need to efficiently route information not just within datacenters, but in remote factories and field offices, and within cloud environments, connected vehicles, sensor arrays and smart homes. With this announcement Solace becomes the only company that can meet all of those centralized and decentralized message routing requirements with appliances and software that share an API and administration framework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our messaging middleware appliance has raised the bar for sharing real-time information between enterprise IT systems, and now the combination of that hardware and our new Virtual Message Router software will transform how information flows through big data, cloud and Internet of Things architectures,&rdquo; said Shawn McAllister, Solace&rsquo;s CTO. &ldquo;Our new Virtual Message Router lets companies deploy rich message routing capabilities into diverse environments such as public and private clouds, connected vehicles, and remote field offices, all using the same infrastructure they use to route information within their datacenters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Solace Virtual Message Router uses the same SolOS messaging software and API as Solace&rsquo;s message router appliances, so it supports all of the same functionality, protocols and capabilities, and uses the same administration framework for management, monitoring and security. Solace appliances and the VMR are functionally equivalent and interoperable so companies can deploy each product where it makes sense and easily transition between form factors as their business grows or requirements change.</p>
<p>The Solace Virtual Message Router; Enterprise Edition for Developers is available now, and the Solace Virtual Message Router; Enterprise Edition for production deployment will be available in the fall of 2015.</p>
