<p>Database as a service platform <a href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a> has just <a href="http://orchestrate.io/blog/2014/10/15/new-enterprise-deployment-options-and-pricing/">announced changes to Orchestrate&rsquo;s subscription plans and pricing</a>. Looking to offset the cost of running multiple databases in production, Orchestrate's enterprise customers can expect to see a cost savings of almost 50% for a single database - to nearly 90% in many instances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new usage plans reflect the value of the Orchestrate.io service, and remain highly competitive to any other database or service you will find on both cost and value. If you&rsquo;ve been tinkering with Orchestrate or have wanted to get started soon, we're offering you a last chance to lock in legacy pricing for life. For the next 72-hours, you can upgrade to the original Starter or Developer plans and not be affected by these changes.<br /><br />To receive the new pricing you have to do is <a href="http://info.orchestrate.io/Upgrade">fill out this form before Saturday, October 17 at 5:00pm</a> pst and Orchestrate.io will honor these prices forever. &nbsp;If you have any questions, or are interested in our private cloud offering or dedicated deployments, we want to hear from you.
