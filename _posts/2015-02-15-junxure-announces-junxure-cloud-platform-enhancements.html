<p><a href="http://www.junxure.com/">Junxure</a>, a leading CRM solutions provider for financial advisors that integrates technology, consulting, and training, today announced the latest release of Junxure Cloud &ndash; the comprehensive, cloud-based CRM/office management solution for advisors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"With this release of Junxure Cloud we have completed the first step toward delivering a ground-breaking way of re-thinking how technology speaks to each other," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Greg Friedman</span>, President of Junxure.</p>
<p>Junxure Cloud's application programming interface (API), allows for deep data sharing that will enable "push/pull" data transmissions between Junxure Cloud and third party and custodial applications. In addition to providing an accelerated timeline for implementing key integrations, advisors will be able to take simple everyday tasks, such as populating a birthday or updating phone number, and capture them in one place &ndash; Junxure Cloud. That data will then propagate across different connected platforms, saving time and reducing potential data entry errors.</p>
<p>"Our mission with Junxure Cloud is to aggressively pursue not only the development of&nbsp;<em>meaningful&nbsp;</em>integrations for advisors, but also to achieve the next level of technology that enables us to create deeper integrations with popular programs," Continued Friedman. "Our new API is the key to helping advisors realize that vision of a truly centralized technology experience with Junxure Cloud at the center."</p>
<p><strong>Other Release Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Client Data Automation &ndash; A powerful new tool that goes beyond tracking and reporting data, this release includes the birthday interface which enables advisors to generate and log correspondence and create actions from one centralized location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>User Experience Enhancements &ndash; More options to easily search, access, and link data and documents to Actions. More filters for grouping Actions and better Action navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>"We have many exciting features on the horizon, including client data forecasting and automation, a powerful dashboard for business intelligence, custom reporting tools, and integrations with custodians, document management solutions, and so much more," said Friedman. "Our goal is to be innovative and agile with our roadmap, delivering 'out of the box' solutions for advisors that reflects our deep knowledge and experience in the industry. We are tremendously excited to share what the future holds for advisors."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Junxure Cloud is available to advisors in a 60-day free trial; training and support are complimentary.</p>
