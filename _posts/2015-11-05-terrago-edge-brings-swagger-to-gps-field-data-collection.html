<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="http://www.terragotech.com/">TerraGo</a>, a pioneer of geospatial collaboration and enterprise mobility software, announces the availability of&nbsp;TerraGo Edge&nbsp;3.8, which features the new TerraGo Edge REST API, auto-recording functions and numerous other enhancements. TerraGo Edge is the industry&rsquo;s first open GPS data collection and collaboration platform capable of high-accuracy data collection, seamlessly utilizing any GPS receiver while integrating with any platform, including GIS, CAD and other enterprise systems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Dan Rodriguez, CEO, RazorTek, &ldquo;The great thing about the REST API is we can rapidly integrate TerraGo Edge with our customers&rsquo; existing GIS applications.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;This means our customers get the best of both worlds. They can fully leverage their current infrastructure investment, while deploying an open mobile data collection solution that interfaces directly with these systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The TerraGo Edge REST API helps customers integrate their applications directly with TerraGo Edge Server functionality using simple HTTP methods in JSON format, with any programming language, on any platform, and utilizing OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. The TerraGo Edge Server REST API is Swagger-enabled, the world&rsquo;s most popular API framework, which provides a simple API representation, interactive documentation, and client SDK generation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;TerraGo Edge&rsquo;s REST API means our customers can easily integrate Edge functions with any GIS, CAD, database or application,&rdquo; said Dave Basil, VP of Products and Services at TerraGo. &ldquo;This integration extends the benefits of an open field data collection solution, enabling enterprises in any industry to deploy mobile workflows that easily integrate with third party systems, without being tethered to proprietary platforms or all-in-one GPS units.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">TerraGo Edge 3.8 also enables auto-recording of any path traveled by field data collection workers. This means customers can automatically record GPS lines and polygons (also known as &ldquo;streaming&rdquo;) on their mobile device using the TerraGo Edge App, to improve the efficiency of field data collection. Users continuously add vertices from their GPS position at defined intervals as they move, to create a digital breadcrumb trail that shows the path they have traveled. Customers can configure TerraGo Edge to record any level of accuracy required, from the on-board location services of iOS&trade; and Android&trade; devices, to the real-time centimeter-accuracy of Bluetooth-connected GPS receivers. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
