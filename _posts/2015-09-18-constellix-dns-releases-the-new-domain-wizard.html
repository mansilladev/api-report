<p><a href="http://www.constellix.com/dns.html">Constellix DNS</a> is releasing new features nearly every week to prepare for the upcoming launch out of Beta. First up for September, Constellix has released the New Domain Wizard. This feature guides users through the process of creating records for their new domains all without leaving the Constellix DNS interface and no associated downtime for users&rsquo; domains. Simply input your domain, choose which records you want to attribute to the domain, and the wizard does the rest for you.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This tool is part of Constellix&rsquo;s efforts to make DNS management easily accessible to all users with differing levels of technical know-how. Our research suggests that the majority of users are IT professionals, however there is a growing subset of business owners who are taking DNS management into their own hands. With more small businesses realizing how affordable outsourced DNS is, &ldquo;we have to make our services more user-friendly for both the technical user and the business owner who chooses to take control of their domains,&rdquo; says President of Constellix Steven Job. As a self-made business owner, Job understands the demands of running your own business and has engineered Constellix around the central ideas of accessibility and simplicity.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The New Domain Wizard breaks down domain creation into three easy steps, domain name, configuring records, and finally you get to see your domain records updated on Constellix name servers. Once you&rsquo;ve completed the wizard, the Constellix name servers are automatically updated using proprietary Instant DNS Updates. The only step left is for the user to contact their domain registrar and update their records for the new name servers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">September will mark a pivotal month for Constellix DNS, as many new features are making their way to user&rsquo;s hands. Here are some new features to look out for in the coming weeks: ANAME records, HTTP redirection records, failover records, API services, and Atomic API. Constellix is currently available for free with DNS Made Easy membership, take Constellix DNS for a test drive today.</p>
