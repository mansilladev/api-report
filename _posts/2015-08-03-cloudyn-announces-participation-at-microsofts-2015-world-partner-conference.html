Cloudyn&rsquo;s support provided companies that adopted Azure or have plans to do so with a way to monitor, compare and right-size all of their cloud deployments and assets from a single pane of glass. Most recently, Cloudyn&rsquo;s platform also became one of the few selected partners to utilize Microsoft&rsquo;s public preview release of its Azure billing API, which allows companies and partners to monitor and correlate cloud consumption and costs by resource tags that users can establish on Azure resources.</p>
