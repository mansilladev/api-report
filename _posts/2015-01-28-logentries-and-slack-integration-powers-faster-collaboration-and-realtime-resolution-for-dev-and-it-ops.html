<p><a href="http://logentries.com/quick-start" target="_blank">Logentries</a>, the leading log management and analytics service built for the cloud, today announced a new integration with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack,</a>&nbsp;the team communication platform, to enable real-time system and application monitoring. Users of both services can now receive real-time notifications, log-level details with timestamps, and event context inside of designated Slack team channels. The custom integration helps users to consolidate the number of tools they are using by bringing together these two must-have DevOps services. The real-time alerts sent from Logentries to Slack provide the necessary information to enable users to understand what happened across their systems and applications, and take action quickly.</p>
<p>"We are excited about the new Logentries and Slack integration," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Kyle Lamy</span>, Lead Software Engineer,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.confidentfs.com/" target="_blank">Confident Financial Solutions.</a>&nbsp;"We no longer have long-threaded email discussions about important events and activity alerts. Now our team is able to discuss the alerts in real-time and determine the best course of action. This improves our response time and keeps everyone informed of issues and resolutions."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Logentries and Slack integration features a custom webhook that offers Slack as an endpoint for real-time alerts and log event information generated by Logentries. The Logentries Community relies on real-time Alerting built on custom-defined Tags, performance thresholds, security policies, as well as Anomaly detection and Inactivity alerting, to monitor critical applications in production and troubleshoot system-wide errors or changes. With the new integration, these types of Alerts can be defined for individual Slack channels and update entire teams or projects when important events or specified patterns occur.</p>
<p>"IT and DevOps teams are busy and don't have time to jump between tools trying to understand system and application performance issues," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Trevor Parsons</span>, Chief Scientist and co-founder, Logentries. "The Slack and Logentries integration will dramatically improve operation teams' real-time communication and ability to quickly respond to critical system events."</p>
<p>The cloud-based Logentries service collects and pre-processes log events in real-time for on-demand analysis, alerting and visualization. With custom tagging and filtering, users can correlate data across their infrastructure to better understand application usage and performance, security and performance issues, and user behavior.
