<p><a href="http://www.hotelwifitest.com/" target="_blank">Hotel WiFi Test</a>&nbsp;has launched a free&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hotelwifitest.com/content-api/" target="_blank">content API</a>&nbsp;designed for travel and hotel booking websites and apps. The API is designed for server-to-server integrations and provides an extremely flexible way to integrate hotel Wi-Fi speed and quality information into any travel-related service.</p>
<p>Many studies continually show that guests rate Wi-Fi as a key hotel amenity. Displaying hotel Wi-Fi quality information on a website or app is therefore a sure way to gain competitive advantage, higher customer satisfaction and better conversion rates.</p>
<p>Hotel WiFi Test has the biggest database of hotel Wi-Fi speed and quality, and has for the first time made this unique content available for integration into other services.</p>
<p>"Our main goal for this launch is to provide hotel WiFi speed and quality information to travellers without them having to leave their favourite travel websites", commented&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Yaroslav Goncharov</span>, founder and CEO of Hotel WiFi Test. "Another critical goal is to integrate this data directly into the hotel selection flow, so that it can be used for searching, sorting and filtering along with other key hotel characteristics, such as price or guest feedback score".</p>
<p>The API&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hotelwifitest.com/content-api/display-requirements/" target="_blank">display requirements</a>&nbsp;are quite easy compared with industry standards. The attribution link can be placed on the content page or included into a booking email.</p>
<p>The API returns all the hotel Wi-Fi quality records in bulk and the incoming data can be stored to implement any user scenarios, including sorting and filtering without any performance implications.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the API and can apply for access using the link below:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hotelwifitest.com/content-api/" target="_blank">https://www.hotelwifitest.com/content-api/</a></p>
