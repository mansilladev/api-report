The concept of taking an API-first approach to development isn't new. Kin Lane <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/11/what-is-an-api-first-strategy-adding-some-dimensions-to-this-new-question/">wrote a blog post</a> about this the very topic back in 2014. However, there hasn't been a lot of community projects/frameworks that directly facilitate an API-first approach. Out of the box, API Platform supports hypermedia APIs, JSON-LD and Hydra. Dunglas built and bundled several useful tools, including docs generation, Schema.org support, entity auto-generation, and more.</p>
 <p>Neil Mansilla from <a href="https://www.runscope.com">Runscope</a> gave API Platform a try, and wrote up a summary in a <a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/create-api-first-web-apps-with-api-platform-a-php-framework">blog post</a>.</p>
