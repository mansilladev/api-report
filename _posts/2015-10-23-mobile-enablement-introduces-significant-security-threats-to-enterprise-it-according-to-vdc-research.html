<p>While the security landscape remains in a statue of flux, a number of vendors actively engaged in developing next-generation mobile security solutions continues to expand, <a href="http://www.vdcresearch.com/landing/maw/15_Maw_Mobile_Security_ExecBrief.aspx">according to a new report from VDC Research</a>. Chip manufacturers continue to enhance their embedded security while handset OEMs expand their respective operating systems with important security and API enhancements. At the same time, venture funding continues to flow to a vibrant ecosystem of security-oriented ISVs. IT departments must constantly assess the best ways to secure and manage a multitude of mobile devices on diverse platforms. Changing work styles increase employees&rsquo; desire or need to work from any location at any time, with data that is accessible from the company network, the Web, or the cloud. IT departments are thus dealing with a moving target and require a broad range of protective measures, depending on their organization&rsquo;s security posture. Due to the multilayered security dynamics of mobile platforms, neither an ideal hardware configuration nor one type of communications network can reliably catch all threats and assure security. Operating systems, applications, devices, and networks all affect security in a dynamic market.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VDC&rsquo;s research shows that IT heads want mobility solutions that will easily and seamlessly integrate into their existing infrastructure and their applications. While business leaders are increasingly aware of the opportunities created by expanding access to critical business applications to mobile platforms, interoperability with existing infrastructure remains a high hurdle for organizations. This is particularly true of those that are embracing BYOD and giving their mobile workforce access to corporate networks, databases, and applications. Security, however, remains the key barrier to true mobile enablement.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The influx of mobile devices at enterprises has not only increased complexity but also made it clear that investments in mobile IT management and security solutions will be required to realize the promise of mobile enablement,&rdquo; says Eric Klein, Director of Enterprise Mobility and Connected Devices at VDC Research. &ldquo;Vulnerabilities such as malware, direct attacks, data interception, exploitation, and social engineering all have transitioned into the mobile space as fluidly as the operating systems themselves.&rdquo;</p>
