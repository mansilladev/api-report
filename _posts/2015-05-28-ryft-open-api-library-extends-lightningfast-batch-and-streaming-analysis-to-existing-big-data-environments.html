<p><a href="http://www.ryft.com/">Ryft</a> announced today the availability of the <a href="http://www.ryft.com/api">Ryft Open API Library</a>, expanding the company&rsquo;s Ryft ONE high-performance data analysis capabilities into existing big data environments. Developers can now invoke or extend the Ryft Open API to add hardware-driven acceleration to applications that demand real-time intelligence from all types of batch and streaming data. Now, Ryft combines the flexibility of an open, future-proof 1U platform with the speed, simplicity, scalability and security of a purpose-built analytics accelerator for 100X faster enterprise decision-making and dramatically better data center economics.</p>
<p>As business and IT buyers have grown tired of costly and brittle closed systems, there has been a rapid shift to open solutions. However, moving to solely open source-based tools running on x86 clusters has introduced a new set of challenges including performance degradation, greatly increased complexity and a widening skills gap. This forced data scientists, business analysts and others to make serious trade-offs in performance and objectives:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Batch data could not be analyzed at the same time as streaming data. </li>
<li> Time-consuming indexing and ETL processes added delays to the already slow status quo. </li>
<li> Users had to wait weeks or months to access costly and cumbersome closed frameworks with the horsepower needed to analyze data. </li>
<li> Strict security controls required for data protection added unacceptable latency to data analysis and decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&ldquo;The era of painful tradeoffs in big data is over. Ryft has introduced a no-compromises solution that doesn&rsquo;t force buyers to choose between speed, simplicity, security, and other critical objectives,&rdquo; said Des Wilson, CEO of Ryft. &ldquo;In fact, the purpose-built Ryft ONE, using the Open API Library, has the performance benefits of a Linux server on steroids but doesn&rsquo;t force users to abandon their existing investments in current Hadoop, Spark and other analytics infrastructures. It fits quickly and easily into every IT environment via the new open API.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Ryft Open API Library is a simple to invoke or extend front-end that developers can use to integrate Ryft ONE hardware-driven acceleration into existing environments and algorithms for unprecedented speed. It provides organizations everything they need to accelerate and gain more value from their business data with:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> A growing set of primitives such as exact search, fuzzy search and term frequency.</li>
<li> Support for high-level programming languages, including C/C++, Java, Python, R, Scala and more.</li>
</ul>
