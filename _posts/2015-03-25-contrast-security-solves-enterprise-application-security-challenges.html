<p><a href="http://www1.contrastsecurity.com">Contrast Security</a>, creator of the world's fastest application security software, today announced new&nbsp;Contrast Enterpris<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www1.contrastsecurity.com/features" target="_blank">e</a>&nbsp;features that respond to the company's customers' need to eliminate risk at an unprecedented scale. Unlike competing products that have not delivered on the promise of fast application security over the last decade, Contrast actually makes securing applications wickedly fast and highly accurate, radically diminishing the number one cybersecurity threat to enterprises today.</p>
<p>Enhancements to Contrast include a broad range of enterprise benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Increased Speed&nbsp;<br /></strong>Over 1/3 of all breaches are a result of application security risks, so it is imperative application security be at least as fast as apps change. Contrast has increased the speed of its distributed agents to work even faster and more transparently, enabling vulnerability identification as applications run at enterprise scale.</p>
<p>Contrast's improved REST API and scriptable zero-configuration installers provide complete automation of application security into any software development life cycle (SDLC) and toolset. Scriptable, no-configuration installers and expert remediation guidance help speed up application delivery. With Contrast Enterprise, there is no more waiting for security to review the code.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Accuracy and Broader Coverage&nbsp;<br /></strong>Fast results mean nothing if those results aren't accurate, comprehensive and actionable. Contrast leverages an unprecedented 10+ information sources that legacy application security tools can't see.&nbsp; This breadth results in the discovery of more real vulnerabilities, more accurately than legacy SAST and DAST tools combined, while eliminating trust-eroding and time-consuming false positives.</p>
<p>Support for the most recent version of Java (Java 8) and legacy versions of Microsoft .NET ensures Contrast-secured enterprises are covered for both incoming and legacy applications. Contrast Enterprise software updates include .NET support for IIS6 and IIS Express for wider coverage of vulnerable legacy applications earlier in the development cycle, helping eliminate vulnerabilities in development.</p>
<p>A number of Contrast Enterprise customers &ndash; particularly those in the financial services and healthcare sector &ndash; frequently utilize standalone applications. Contrast Enterprise has extended its coverage to include these critical corporate applications.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to Use&nbsp;<br /></strong>Contrast's new enterprise features provide corporate deployment and integration with Microsoft Active Directory&nbsp;(AD) and LDAP services, greatly accelerating and simplifying the onboarding of new Contrast users within complex organizations.</p>
<p>Once users are on-boarded, they benefit from a new and modern user experience and dozens of feature and design improvements. These updates ensure a wide range of non-experts will quickly find, prioritize and remediate application risks themselves.</p>
<p>"We launched and have continued to build on Contrast to respond to the needs of enterprises that have been woefully underserved by legacy application security providers and technologies," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Jeff Williams</span>, founder and CTO of Contrast Security. "With Contrast Enterprise, we're succeeding in our mission to deliver powerful and innovative technology that fills a market vacuum and obviates the traditionally slow, inaccurate and expert-only status quo. Contrast gives enterprises the power to stop attacks at portfolio scale without compromising speed or accuracy."</p>
<p>Contrast Enterprise was first launched in 2013. Since then, it has been rapidly adopted by a diverse range of enterprise customers, including some of the largest financial institutions in the world. As a testament to the product's effectiveness, Contrast Security&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www1.contrastsecurity.com/press-releases/contrast-security-named-a-leader-in-application-security-by-independent-research-firm" target="_blank">was named a leader</a>&nbsp;in the Forrester Wave&trade; Application Security, Q4 2014 report.

In addition to the Forrester acknowledgement, the company was also&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www1.contrastsecurity.com/press-releases/contrast-security-positioned-as-a-visionary-in-the-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-applica" target="_blank">positioned by Gartner, Inc.</a>&nbsp;in the Visionaries quadrant of the 2014 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing.</p>

Contrast's customers have also recognized the effectiveness of this role.</p>
