<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="http://www.getalma.com/">Alma Technologies, Inc.</a>, and Google Classroom today announced the integration between the popular free classroom toolset for teachers and a Student Information System (SIS). The integration enables Alma customers to set up a Google Classroom for every one of their teachers with a single click.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Alma used all of the functionality afforded by the Classroom API. For customers that manage their Google Classrooms through Alma, the roster is automatically synchronized with the SIS in real time. As students enroll and un-enroll from classes, those changes are instantly reflected in Google Classroom. In addition, Alma allows its customers to manage Google Classrooms directly from Alma. School administrators can see which teachers have synchronized Google Classrooms, delete classrooms or detach classrooms that the school wants to use but no longer wants to sync with Alma.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The benefits of this integration to schools and districts using Alma&rsquo;s hybrid SIS/LMS platform include reduced friction for educators comfortable working in the Google Classroom environment, as well as the benefit for students of being able to continue to submit assignments in Classroom. In addition, the integration does not require nightly CSV uploads or manual entry to keep rosters synced, so students have instant access to important learning tools and materials without having to wait for their software to catch up. The student and parent portal contains clear links to each Google Classroom to help students easily access their classes, so teachers can maximize instruction time and productivity and reduce the need to help students access their Classroom and assignments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Together with Google Classroom, Alma takes an important step closer to disrupting the K-12 ed-tech space with better, more modern tools at a fraction of the cost,&rdquo; said Jack Macleod, President of Alma. &ldquo;Our educators really deserve time-savers like this &ndash; such innovation is long overdue, and this is just the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Zach Yeskel, Product Manager for Google Classroom, said: &ldquo;Alma is solving real problems in schools, and we&rsquo;re excited that with this integration schools will be able to use Alma and Classroom together seamlessly," said "We&rsquo;re looking forward to exploring opportunities for further integrations that save teachers and students time.&rdquo;</p>
