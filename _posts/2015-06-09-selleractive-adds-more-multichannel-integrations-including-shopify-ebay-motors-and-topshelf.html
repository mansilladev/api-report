<p><a href="http://www.selleractive.com">Order and inventory management SaaS, SellerActive</a>, has added Shopify, eBay Motors, topShelf, and Shiplogistix to their long list of integrations.</p>
<p>SellerActive now connects seamlessly with Shopify, one of the world's leading e-commerce platforms for small and medium-sized businesses. Integrating with Shopify's API, SellerActive pulls product listings directly without manual upload. Users can monitor, manage, and send orders to be fulfilled for their Shopify stores on one centralized dashboard while eliminating tedious manual data entry and errors.</p>
<p>With more people turning to the internet to search and purchase cars, eBay Motors is the destination marketplace for merchants and buyers. With this latest integration between SellerActive and eBay Motors, merchants selling cars, motorcycles, auto parts, and accessories can use SellerActive's dynamic repricing software to maximize sales, along with automatic syncing of their inventory and orders.</p>
<p>In addition to new marketplaces, SellerActive has integrated with order fulfilment players like ShipLogisitix and Scout's topShelf. ShipLogistix offers third-party fulfillment and supply chain management, while the topShelf integration will benefit customers who want to combine SellerActive's order and inventory management tools with topShelf's warehouse management software.</p>
<p>"We're anticipating the needs of not only our current customers, but of our next 1,000 customers as well," said Jon Le Boeuf, SellerActive sales manager. "Our goal has always been to eliminate the time-consuming back-office processes e-commerce sellers face, allowing them to focus on growing their business and sales. To do that we need to continue to expand our available integrations while forecasting changes in repricing and inventory management before they happen. "</p>
<p>With the launch of their new dashboard last month, SellerActive has more ambitious plans for 2015 with further updates to the interface, integrations, pricing strategies, and a product lister for eBay.
