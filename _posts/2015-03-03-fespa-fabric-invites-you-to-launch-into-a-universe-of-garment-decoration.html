<p><a href="http://2015.fespa.com">FESPA</a>&nbsp;is calling on all printers with an interest in garment decoration to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fespafabric.com/">FESPA Fabric 2015</a>, taking place within&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fespa2015.com/">FESPA 2015 Global Expo</a>&nbsp;from 18-22 May 2015, in Cologne, Germany.</p>
<p>44% larger than FESPA Fabric 2013 in London, this year&rsquo;s show will showcase the largest constellation of garment decoration opportunities of any FESPA event to date. The &lsquo;pink planet&rsquo; at FESPA 2015 represents FESPA Fabric, where visitors can explore even more technologies, consumables, applications, innovations and trends relevant to garment decoration, using both analogue and digital processes.</p>
<p>Roz McGuinness, FESPA Divisional Director, comments: &ldquo;Garment decoration and textile print are rapidly expanding areas of the industry for print service providers, with many businesses still looking to enter this space. Interim results from FESPA&rsquo;s Print Census show that 71% of our community see textiles for garment as a growing area for their wide format business, while 34% of participants specified that they look for textile printing capabilities when purchasing a new device. FESPA Fabric 2015 delivers the perfect platform to explore the relevant opportunities available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 44% growth in our floor space shows that many of our exhibitors see value and demand in this area. Growth for this year&rsquo;s event is mostly down to the increased presence of digital textile suppliers. At the other end of the technology spectrum, we&rsquo;re also seeing strength in numbers from our screen community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FESPA Fabric 2015 features a plethora of equipment, consumables, substrate and apparel suppliers including Brother, Chemica, Kiian Digital, J-Teck, Hebbecker, M&amp;R, MHM, Melco, Siser, S Roque Stahls and FESPA Fabric Corporate Partner, Kornit Digital.</p>
<p>Visitors will also benefit from practical and theoretical sessions on garment printing hosted by industry experts in the FESPA Education Hub, located in Hall 8, stand B90. The seminars cover a variety of different applications and techniques printers can use to produce high quality garments.</p>
<p>Conference sessions will include topics such as&nbsp;<em>Direct to Garment Printing &ndash; Should We or Shouldn&rsquo;t We?&nbsp;</em>with Gavin Drake, director of customised clothing company, Print This Print That. Colour correction guru Marco Olivotto will discuss&nbsp;<em>the recolouration of textile patterns.&nbsp;</em>For PSPs looking to&nbsp;<em>implement an ecommerce print-on-demand system,&nbsp;</em>the<em>&nbsp;</em>seminar with Christopher Bernat from Vapor Apparel/Source Custom should not be missed.</p>
<p>Digital textile printer Spoonflower, will present its application programming interface which enables individuals to design and print their own textiles, during their seminar&nbsp;<em>Using the Spoonflower API</em>. In her&nbsp;<em>Textile Tech Time&nbsp;</em>session renowned industry consultant, Sophie Matthews-Paul will look at why businesses are still reluctant to move into digital textile printing and what manufacturers can do to create a greater understanding of the industry. Oliver Luedtke, European marketing manager, Kornit Digital, will discuss how printers can diversify into direct-to-garment printing, in&nbsp;<em>How to Become a Garment Printer 101</em>.</p>
<p>FESPA favourite Charlie Taublieb will return to FESPA Fabric 2015 to host daily practical workshops offering advice on various screen printing techniques, including&nbsp;<em>Intro to Screen Printing, Designing for Black Shirts; and Documentation &ndash; effective paperwork for screen printing businesses</em>.</p>
<p>Roz McGuinness concludes: &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s FESPA Fabric is set to take garment printers on an inspiring journey to discover out-of-this-world textile applications and technologies. The show provides an environment for visitors to learn how adding garment and promotional products to their portfolio will benefit wide format businesses. Textiles for interiors will also feature strongly within the new showcase event,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.printeriors.net/">Printeriors</a>, which is running alongside FESPA 2015.&rdquo;</p>
