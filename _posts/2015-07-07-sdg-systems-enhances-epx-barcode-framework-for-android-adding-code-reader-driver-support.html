SDG has created EPX-B hardware drivers to support USB-based Code Reader&trade; scanners from Code Corporation. From a single SDK, using a Java application programming interface (API) for Android, EPX-B now supports Code, Symbol, Honeywell and Intermec hardware-decoded scan engines. EPX-B is also capable of using Android&rsquo;s integrated system camera to decode barcodes using libraries originally developed by the ZXing project.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;SDG Systems continues to ensure a broad selection of applications and hardware are supported with our EPX Framework,&rdquo; said Todd Blumer, President of SDG Systems. &ldquo;In supporting the Poynt mobile terminal and cost-effective scanners from Code Corporation, we continue to provide small and mid-sized business with a way to easily integrate barcode scanning into their POS, medical, hospitality or other Android-based solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SDG Systems has tested the Code Reader driver on the following OEM products from Code Corporation:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Reader CR1000&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code Reader CR8000 Scan Engine</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Other Code Readers that support USB native two-way communication are expected to work unmodified with the driver, and may be tested upon request. The Code Reader driver is currently in public beta and may be purchased at a beta discount price of $0.99. Access to the beta is controlled through SDG&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="EPX-Barcode Google+ Group" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9wbHVzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvMTE1OTQyMDU3MzMzNjc3OTY4MTIy">EPX-Barcode Scanner Beta Google+ Group</a>.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Scanners may be connected to and controlled from the USB port of the Poynt payment terminal. Developers can integrate with the Poynt terminal using a licensed driver and free SDK from SDG Systems. For un-tethered convenience, support for Bluetooth-connected Code Scanners, like the CR2300, is planned. The driver is expected to support full bi-directional communication.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OEMs interested in integrating EPX-B into their Android hardware platforms should contact SDG Systems for licensing information. ISVs wanting to support EPX-B APIs may download the free&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="EPX-Barcode SDK" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2RldmVsb3Blci5zZGdzeXN0ZW1zLmNvbS9zZGsvZXB4Lw==">Software Developer Kit (SDK) from SDG Systems&rsquo; website</a>. Support for additional barcode scanners is planned. USB-based OEM scanners that use scan engines from EPX-B-supported vendors (Code and Symbol) should work without modification when properly configured.</p>
