<p>The corporate messaging tool has announced the release of a new version (7.1.5.29). The new version of the software is one of the communication solution&rsquo;s regular scheduled updates. As always the new version is available free to all current DeskAlerts subscribers and is packed full of tweaks and upgrades to enhance the user experience, convenience and messaging efficiency.</p>
<p>Along with announcing the launch of version 7.1.5.29, DeskAlerts has outlined a raft of completed development advances. These include major changes focused on the functioning of the API, changes to the ticker messaging function and a series of smaller bug fixes and minor changes to usability.</p>
<p>One of the major raft of changes specific to the release of version 7.1.5.29 relates to the system&rsquo;s API function. In the latest incarnation, DeskAlerts users will enjoy a significant enhancement to API options including a newly introduced ability to target the alert being sent via the DeskAlerts API function to specific IP groups. This addition means that users can concisely disseminate desired messages with precision geographic targeting. The ability to target via geographical area adds another incredibly useful tool to the <a title="corporate communication" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGVydC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20v">corporate communication</a> manager&rsquo;s arsenal, allowing for further refinement of corporate notifications.</p>
<p>A second upgrade to the DeskAlerts API function also makes its debut in software release 7.1.5.29. Users upgrading to the latest version will see a new icon appear, which makes it possible to send an emergency message alert via the API.</p>
<p>Roman Toporkov, Lead Developer at DeskAlerts said, &ldquo;We have been working long and hard on adding even more flexibility and power to our API function and are delighted to be finally introducing the changes in our new version release. Making the emergency message alert function available to members adds an extra level of convenience and means that DeskAlerts messaging and corporate messaging can now play a true part in disaster preparedness planning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also extremely pleased with the IP group targeting introduced by our engineering and development team. We foresee this being a particularly useful feature. It&rsquo;s clearly a very relevant addition to our suite of capabilities, given that so many DeskAlerts subscribers select our messaging system precisely because they are located in different geographical locations to colleagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along with the extended API, this week&rsquo;s new DeskAlerts release also marks the introduction of major changes to the alert solution&rsquo;s ticker module. The scrolling news ticker is one of the mainstays of DeskAlerts, providing news alerts in a ticker style format on user desktops. The tool is ideal for those who need to ensure employees are kept appraised of frequently changing information. The ticker is effective but unobtrusive and can be used to send material such as news feeds, articles, resource links and other data directly to employee devices. As the ticker is desktop based, this means of messaging means the news is conveyed without the need for employees to check email, providing instant updates when it matters the most.</p>
<p>In version 7.1.5.29, there is no a docked tickers option. This change is designed to enhance and encourage productivity by ensuring that tickers do no overlap the user&rsquo;s work area. This means that ticker alerts remain visible yet unobtrusive and do not interrupt the work the user may be carrying out.</p>
<p>Other popular ticker functions remain in place and unaffected by this change, including the option to use with ActiveDirectory and eDirectory, statistics, scheduling, recurrence and autoclose. With the docked ticker feature, users can still receive multiple messages and access ticker history. The ticker can also be branded in corporation colors and logos to enhance <a title="corporate communications" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGVydC1zb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20v">corporate communications</a>.</p>
<p>Toporkov added, &ldquo;We confident that release 7.1.5.29 is our best yet. All of the improvements, tweaks and fixes made have the sole aim of improving messaging efficiency, giving users ever more intuitive ways of using DeskAlerts as part of their messaging systems and offering a robust, practical and seamless service that meets the needs of businesses large and small.&rdquo;</p>
