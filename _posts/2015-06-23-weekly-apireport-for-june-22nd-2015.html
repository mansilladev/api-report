<p>Day late, and a dollar short, but here is the report for last week. Some interesting nuggets for reading later in there. I learn so much doing this work.</p>
<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>Kicking the week off with some&nbsp;<strong>101:</strong></p>
