<p><a href="http://slamdata.com/murray/">SlamData Inc. today announced a new white paper</a> that explores the evolution of analytics for semi-structured data models, and outlines the capabilities that systems must have to support generalized analytics on modern data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SlamData Inc. is the company behind the SlamData open source project, the industry-leading application for visual analytics on NoSQL data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"In this new age of semi-structured data, a lot of companies are talking about analytics. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot of conflation and confusion," said John A. De Goes, CTO at SlamData. "Companies are desperately looking for a way to cut through all the noise, and figure out what capabilities they need to understand the NoSQL data they have. For the first time ever, this white paper systematically defines what a NoSQL analytics system is and what it can do."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Broad new technology trends in computing are driving unprecedented growth of semi-structured data, including web APIs (JSON and XML), web and mobile applications, NoSQL databases, Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced machine learning that can robustly transform unstructured data into semi-structured data. With so much business-critical data locked behind new NoSQL data models, it has become more important than ever for companies to figure out a strategy for NoSQL analytics.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Titled Characteristics of NoSQL Analytics Systems, this white paper provides a rigorous definition of NoSQL analytics, which systematically explores eight characteristics of NoSQL analytics systems. Each of these characteristics enables solving common analytic scenarios across modern NoSQL data models.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The white paper covers a wide range of critical topics for architects, data engineers, data scientists, and analysts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>History of NoSQL analytics&nbsp;</li>
<li>The problems with ETL and custom coding&nbsp;</li>
<li>The diverse sources of NoSQL data&nbsp;</li>
<li>Next-generation NoSQL analytics systems&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eight characteristics that all NoSQL systems must have to handle arbitrary analytics on today&rsquo;s modern data models</li>
</ul>
