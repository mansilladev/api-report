<p><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, a leader in software quality tools for the connected world, released a new plugin for&nbsp;Ready! API&nbsp;that integrates with&nbsp;Amazon API Gateway. The new plugin allows API consumers and testers to read an API from Amazon API Gateway and quickly generate a test framework based on the API service description. Amazon API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale, offers all the power of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) stack with an affordable pay-as-you-go model. Ready! API is one of the most popular platforms for ensuring API quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;Enterprises throughout the world are adopting Amazon API Gateway to eliminate the cost and complexity of managing APIs so that their developers can focus on building great apps&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Amazon API Gateway is the perfect fit for Ready! API, offering powerful capabilities within an affordable framework and an ecosystem of open source tooling like the&nbsp;Swagger Importer,&rdquo; said&nbsp;John Purcell, Vice President of Products, API Readiness at SmartBear. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to extend that power to our customers, allowing them to import an API for testing and virtualization as well as easily deploy new APIs to Amazon API Gateway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Testers can quickly generate a virtual API while importing from Amazon API Gateway, which allows testing of various simulations in a controlled environment. Testers can also deploy new APIs to Amazon API Gateway, using Ready! API to develop and test APIs, and deploy the API when ready to push it to a shared environment, a key differentiator of this plugin. This integration delivers 1) a quick and easy way to go from Amazon API Gateway to test, 2) power of API virtualization with a one-click setup and 3) seamless deployment to Amazon API Gateway from within Ready! API.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enterprises throughout the world are adopting Amazon API Gateway to eliminate the cost and complexity of managing APIs so that their developers can focus on building great apps,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Marco Argenti, Vice President, Mobile, AWS. &ldquo;As development practices evolve, developers have the opportunity to&nbsp;embrace new toolkits and methodologies for deploying and testing their code. Amazon API Gateway makes it easy for our customers to build and deliver API-based services.&nbsp;Software companies like&nbsp;SmartBear play an important role in the developer ecosystem by creating innovative tools for AWS customers to automate API testing and delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ready! API, SmartBear&rsquo;s API Readiness platform, is a unified set of testing tools that includes&nbsp;SoapUI NG<span class="bwuline">&nbsp;</span>for functional testing,LoadUI NG Pro<span class="bwuline">&nbsp;</span>for load testing,&nbsp;ServiceV Pro&nbsp;for API service virtualization and&nbsp;Secure Pro&nbsp;for dynamic API security testing.
