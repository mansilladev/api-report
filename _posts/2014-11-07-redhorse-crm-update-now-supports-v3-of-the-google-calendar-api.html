<p>On November 17, Google officially deprecates v1 and v2 of its Calendar API. In time for this API end of life, <a href="https://redhorsesystems.com/">RedHorse CRM v6.6</a> includes a new version of its Google sync utilizing the latest Google v3 Calendar API.</p>
<p>RedHorse&rsquo;s background integration automatically synchronizes contacts and calendar between RedHorse and Google and also copies emails from Gmail for a complete contact history in the customer&rsquo;s CRM. This integration has been key for many RedHorse users to synchronize information to their smart phones and handheld devices.</p>
<p>As Google periodically updates its APIs to improve the functionality it provides to integrators and increases efficiency and security, RedHorse must also keep its integration up to date. &ldquo;Technology advances quickly, and this Google end-of-life announcement is one of many that we have seen over the years,&rdquo; says Connie Galligan, founder of RedHorse Systems. &ldquo;We are committed to making sure our products are up to date. We use them ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
