<p><a href="http://www.routehappy.com">Routehappy</a>, the product differentiation platform for air travel, today announced a worldwide agreement with Google to integrate flight amenity data from its Scores &amp; Happiness Factors API into Google Flights results. This integration will allow Google Flights users in all geographies to see and compare amenities by flight, including seat type, in-seat power, and Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>"We know people are looking for more information about the flights they're taking before they buy, so integrating Routehappy Happiness Factors is a great addition to Google Flights. Now even more people have access to comprehensive flight amenity data and useful flight search information," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Gianni Marostica</span>, Director Business Development, Travel, Google.</p>
<p>Routehappy's Scores &amp; Happiness Factor data is derived from two proprietary Routehappy systems, Flightpad and Flightmatch. Routehappy researches and verifies flight amenities by aircraft, cabin, schedule, and route on a constant basis from hundreds of disparate sources to create Flightpad, the most comprehensive, accurate comparable product attribute dataset for flights worldwide. Flightmatch is a set of powerful and intelligent algorithms that dynamically match and score Happiness Factors, duration, and ratings for billions of possible flight combinations.</p>
<p>"Air travel has never been more differentiated, with airlines investing billions of dollars in their products and fundamentally changing how they sell flights. Airlines and distributors need data, content, and tools to manage their product differentiation," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Robert Albert</span>, Routehappy CEO. "Google Flights is innovating flight search in powerful new ways, including offering lightning fast search and now more comprehensive amenity data for flyers. We're thrilled to be partnering with Google in bringing useful information to flyers everywhere."</p>
