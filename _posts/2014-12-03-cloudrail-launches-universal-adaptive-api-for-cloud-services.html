<p><a href="http://cloudrail.com/">CloudRail</a> has launched <a href="http://cloudrail.com/pr-cloudrail-launches-universal-adaptive-api-cloud-services/">CloudRail for Cloud Storage Services</a>. By simply integrating the CloudRail adaptive API, software developers can seamlessly connect their application with other services faster and easier than ever before. This one-to-many approach works because the CloudRail interface can download special API definitions to automatically adapt to other systems. This dramatically speeds up the development process and allows developers to focus on building stunning software instead of wasting time for integrations.</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;Convenience and fast development. The best facility for integrating cloud services through a single API with entire security&rdquo; stated John Haden of TrooMobile, a leading web and mobile app development company that was part of CloudRail&sup1;s early adopter program.</em></blockquote>
<p>Core features and features of CloudRail include:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Easy integrations </strong>- connect applications to more services, thus increasing customer reach</li>
<li><strong>Faster and cheaper -</strong> a single API for connecting to all cloud storage providers</li>
<li><strong>Automatic API updates -</strong> the CloudRail interface updates with providers change API. Developer maintenance cost go to zero</li>
<li><strong>No middleware - </strong>conversion happens in the client, so the data never passes through CloudRail. It is a peer-to-peer connection with the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>The product is available immediately at http://www.cloudrail.com. Developers can get started for free and grow into the Premium and Enterprise offerings with scale.</p>
