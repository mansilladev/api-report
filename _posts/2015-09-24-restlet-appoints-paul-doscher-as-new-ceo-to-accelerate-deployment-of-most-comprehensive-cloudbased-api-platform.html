<p><a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, creators of the most widely deployed framework for APIs, today announced that Paul Doscher has been named as the company&rsquo;s President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of Restlet&rsquo;s Board of Directors.  Previously, Doscher served as CEO of enterprise open source, analytics, and search companies including LucidWorks and Jaspersoft. Earlier in his career, Doscher held senior executive roles at Exalead, BusinessObjects, Oracle, and VMware. In the Restlet community, Doscher will also be known as the Old Surfer Dude.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">He succeeds founder and longtime CEO, Jerome Louvel, who will become CTO and VP of Engineering and continue to sit on Restlet's Board of Directors. As Restlet&rsquo;s Chief Geek, he will lead efforts to expand REST API development and usage in companies of all sizes. Under Louvel&rsquo;s leadership, Restlet grew from an open source project that Louvel initiated and developed into a global technology company with a comprehensive platform serving API developers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely pleased that we have someone with Paul&rsquo;s experience to grow Restlet&rsquo;s leadership position in API platforms,&rdquo; said Louvel. &ldquo;Restlet has the most complete API cloud platform in the industry and our ease of use makes it the best choice for businesses of any size to publish and consume data and services as APIs. Paul will help Restlet to scale so we can help more businesses use APIs to handle the exploding number of devices, applications and use cases that need to be supported in today&rsquo;s digital economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud to be joining a firm that is on the cusp of the next evolution of API design, development and deployment,&rdquo; said Doscher. &ldquo;Unlike other vendors, Restlet offers a comprehensive platform for APIs in the cloud, eliminating barriers for adoption with a low-friction, self-service model. Restlet is in the lead to bring about the consumerization of APIs to the broadest number of organizations and use cases.&rdquo;</p>
