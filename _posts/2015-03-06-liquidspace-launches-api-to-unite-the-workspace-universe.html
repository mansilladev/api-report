Additionally, several LiquidSpace venue partners have used LiquidSpace's API to integrate proprietary systems.</p>
<p>"The demand for real-time access to flexible workspace is growing rapidly," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Doug Marinaro</span>, President and Chief Strategy Officer for LiquidSpace. "As we enhance the end-to-end experience for our customers, our API opens our real-time marketplace to a broader ecosystem of partners, starting with venue management systems and on-site wall tablets. It will enable us in the future to integrate with work-related services such as catering for a meeting, personal assistant or courier services, and ground transportation, all of which could be booked at the same time someone books a workspace."</p>
<p>LiquidSpace customers see real-time availability and can instantly book and trust that reservations are confirmed in real-time at more than 5,500 workspaces in over 600 cities in the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://liquidspace.com/" target="_blank">U.S.</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://liquidspace.com/v/CA" target="_blank">Canada</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://liquidspace.com/Browse/Campaign/Australia" target="_blank">Australia</a>. Flexible offices, meeting rooms and coworking spaces are available to book by the hour, day or longer through&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.liquidspace.com/" target="_blank">LiquidSpace.com</a>&nbsp;or its mobile app for&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liquidspace/id420584007?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liquidspace" target="_blank">Android</a>. More than 750,000 workspace reservations were processed through LiquidSpace last year with customers ranging from individual freelancers to Fortune 500 executives and teams.</p>
<p>"LiquidSpace's real-time, seamless integration with the other workspace management platforms we use, including Cobot and our wall tablets, gives us the best of everything we need to manage and grow our business," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Craig Cussimanio</span>, COO, The Port Workspaces. "Making our venue available for bookings in the LiquidSpace online marketplace is an important marketing tool and has opened significant revenue opportunities for us in the past year."</p>
