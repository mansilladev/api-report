<p><a href="http://www.PicFeed.net">PicFeed</a> released its new API as a service that provide developers with a stream of ready to use pictures. All the developers need to do is specify a few basic parameters of the pictures they want, call the API, and PicFeed will do the rest.</p>
<p>PicFeed is an API as a service provider that takes the visual aspects of building new websites and applications to the cloud. Web and application developers that need to use images in their products don&rsquo;t need to take care of selecting and uploading the images. The PicFeed API provides them with a stream of ready to use pictures.</p>
<p>One of PicFeed&rsquo;s key features allow developers to select the characteristics of the pictures they want to display. Send the API request with few parameters, and the API will respond with stream of pictures ready to use. For example, developers can specify the image size and resolution, as well as varied aspects of the image content (like location, the image main subject etc.). The current service is free to use on any mobile app or site, and pro-features will be added in the near future.</p>
<p>Established on the spring of 2014, PicFeed&rsquo;s goal is to become the go-to place for all web and app developers that need an online image stream for their new products. This powerful cloud service provides the developers with the images they need, at the time they need them. The API that was developed is easy to use and requires very basic programming skills.</p>
