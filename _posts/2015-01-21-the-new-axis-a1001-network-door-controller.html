<p>The Reading-based distributor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.norbain.co.uk/">Norbain</a>&nbsp;can now offer customers the new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.axis.com/">Axis</a>&nbsp;A1001 Network Door Controller with built-in web-based software. Axis has added its physical access control products to its network video products. The controller is a smart, independent device at each door, so system management can be carried out from the controller.</p>
<p>The companies describe the product as the first non-proprietary and open IP-based access controller on the market.</p>
<p>Axis Entry Manager (Axis A1001 with built-in software) is described as a ready-made solution for small- to mid-sized businesses &ndash; such as offices, commercial premises and retail stores &ndash; with typically ten doors and basic access control requirements.</p>
<p>For larger systems, the Axis A1001&rsquo;s open Application Programming Interface (API) enables Axis&rsquo; Application Development Partners (ADP) to meet specific customer requirements.</p>
<p>According to the firms, the controller allows integration with other IP systems such as fire and intrusion detection. A PoE supported controller at each door eliminates the need for separate power cables for door equipment such as locks and readers.</p>
