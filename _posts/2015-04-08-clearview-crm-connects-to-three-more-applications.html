<p><a href="http://www.softrek.com/fundraising-software/clearview-fundraising-software">Fundraising software ClearView CRM from SofTrek Corporation</a> recently added to the slate of applications with which the system connects. All the applications will help ClearView's nonprofit clients conduct their fundraising efforts more efficiently and accurately by &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to one another directly. New integrations comprise the following accounting, call center and social engagement applications:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Workday Financial Management, a cloud-based suite of accounting applications including grants management and reporting.</li>
<li>USA800, an inbound call center that allows nonprofits to outsource their constituent-support and telephone donation-processing needs.</li>
<li>Crowdster, a group of social applications like networking, cause marketing, event registration and more.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>ClearView CRM&rsquo;s donor database now connects through APIs (application programming interfaces) with some 40 applications that nonprofits use regularly, such as accounting, credit-card payment processing, giving analytics, prospect research, email marketing and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always had a philosophical commitment to openness for ClearView CRM,&rdquo; said Robert Girardi, SofTrek&rsquo;s president and CEO. &ldquo;These new integrations reflect our continuing efforts to expand the range of applications to which clients can connect our constituent relationship management system.&rdquo;</p>
