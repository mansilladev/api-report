"Within the first 15 minutes of using USM for AWS, it provided a ton of useful information specifically USM leveraged CloudTrail and was able to identify previously unknown API activities. AlienVault USM for AWS is a must have for increasing security of AWS deployments."</p>

<ul>
<li>Security Visibility with AWS "Shared Responsibility Model": Cloud-native security platform enhances visibility of potential threats or misconfigurations, through streamlined access to AWS built-in features like AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) Security Groups for immediate insight into potential issues in your environment.</li>
<li>Built-in Security Capabilities Adapted for AWS: Asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, behavior monitoring, log management, alerting and event correlation enables IT or Security practitioners to quickly update and respond to malicious behavior and configuration issues.</li>

</ul>
