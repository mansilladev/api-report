<p><a href="https://www.genedata.com/">Genedata</a>, a leading provider of advanced software solutions for drug discovery and life science research, today unveiled Genedata Screener&reg; version 13.0 at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2015. This latest version of the leading platform for all in-vitro screening brings to market a rich set of new capabilities. Screener now supports High Throughput Flow Cytometry (HT-Flow) and Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK) screens and delivers enhancements to High Content, Thermal Shift, and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) screening experiments. The new version will be demonstrated at ELRIG, September 2-3 (Telford International Conference Centre Booth #G3), with the solution&rsquo;s SPR capabilities showcased in the AstraZeneca/Genedata joint poster &ldquo;Screening by SPR: Workflow and Software for Efficient Data Processing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Evolution through Customer Collaboration <br />Genedata Screener, which supports all screening technologies and instruments, is relied on by the world&rsquo;s leading pharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations, and academic research institutions. Highly collaborative partnerships with these organizations and instrument vendors drive the Screener platform&rsquo;s continuous improvement and uniquely enable Genedata to introduce and advance support for the most sophisticated and innovative screening technologies.  Therefore, Genedata Screener continually evolves to meet new research needs, reduce maintenance, and accelerate processing. Version 13.0 reflects this evolution with new capabilities &ndash; all developed through industry partnerships - such as:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Screener for HT Flow supports automatic compensation of data import from FCS3.1 files as well as standardized processing of complete HT-Flow Cytometry campaigns as measured, for example, with IntelliCyt instrumentation. New gating options for cell-population definition, across a complete campaign, allow users to adapt and refine well-response quantification in the context of the complete experiment.</li>
<li> DMPK capabilities offer increased analysis efficiency and comparability for in-vitro clearance, lipophilicity, and solubility assays based on mass spectrometry technology. While conventional processing and analysis tend to be manual and typically deal with a small number of batches, Screener 13.0 enables standardized parallel processing and result review across a large number of experiments, including automated result reporting to corporate data warehouses.Screener for SPR now handles both single-injection and multi-injection (kinetic titration) protocols and complete data analysis automation for repetitive experiments.</li>
<li>The Thermal Shift Assay Package now contains the often-requested Boltzmann fit.</li>
<li>The Reference Assay Extension enables verification of assay processing and in-depth review of final results through simultaneous assessment of multiple assays. It allows researchers to review numerical and visual assay results, interactively adjust processing settings, and create cross-assay hit lists.</li>
<li>REST (Representational State Transfer) API, built according to standard web technologies, provides easy integration, fast querying, and on-demand access to all results and content stored in the Screener Database.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Genedata Screener 13.0 also features a host of enhancements that improve the user experience. Eliminating repetitive tasks and accelerating the pace of result calculations, the fully automated workflows enable flexibility on assay setup and subsequent reviews. The completely renovated Compound Mapping Wizard supports Compound Combination experiments as well as sub-experiment creation &ndash; all of which enable efficient processing across multiple conditions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;Since it first launched in 2001, each version of Genedata Screener continues to break new ground in support of innovative screening technologies and researcher requirements,&rdquo; noted Dr. Othmar Pfannes, CEO of Genedata. &ldquo;While supporting all screening technologies and workflows, Genedata Screener remains a single, efficient, and low-maintenance platform. No other single system on the market can match Screener&rsquo;s simplicity and ease of supporting the vast array of available screening technologies.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Availability</strong> <br />Starting on September 9, 2015, the Genedata Screener 13.0 Early Access Program will open for existing customers who would like to explore new Screener functionality. Genedata Screener 13.0 will be released for general availability on October 6, 2015.</p>
