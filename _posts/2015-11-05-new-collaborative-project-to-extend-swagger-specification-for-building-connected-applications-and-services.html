<p><a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a>, the nonprofit&nbsp;organization dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux and collaborative&nbsp;development, today is announcing the <a href="https://openapis.org">Open API Initiative</a>. Founding members of&nbsp;the Open API Initiative include 3Scale, Apigee, Capital One, Google, IBM, Intuit,&nbsp;Microsoft, PayPal, Restlet and SmartBear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Initiative will extend the Swagger specification and format to create an open&nbsp;technical community within which members can easily contribute to building a&nbsp;vendor neutral, portable and open specification for providing metadata for&nbsp;RESTful APIs. This open specification will allow both humans and computers to&nbsp;discover and understand the capabilities of the respective services with a&nbsp;minimal amount of implementation logic. The Initiative will also promote and&nbsp;facilitate the adoption and use of an open API standard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swagger is considered one of the most popular frameworks for building APIs.&nbsp;When an open source project reaches this level of maturity, it just can&rsquo;t be&nbsp;managed by one company, organization or developer,&rdquo; said Jim Zemlin,&nbsp;executive director at The Linux Foundation. &ldquo;The Open API Initiative will extend&nbsp;this technology to advance connected application development through open&nbsp;standards.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swagger was created in 2010 and offered under an open source license a year&nbsp;later. It is a description format used by developers in industries ranging from&nbsp;consumer electronics to energy, finance, healthcare, government, media and&nbsp;travel to design and deliver APIs that support a range of connected applications&nbsp;and services. With downloads of Swagger and Swagger tooling nearly tripling&nbsp;over the last year, it is considered the most popular open source framework for&nbsp;defining and creating RESTful APIs. SmartBear recently acquired the Swagger&nbsp;API open source project from Reverb Technologies and today is working with its&nbsp;industry peers to ensure the specification and format can be advanced for years&nbsp;to come.</p>
<p>The open governance model for the Open API Initiative includes a Technical&nbsp;Developer Committee (TDC) that will maintain and evolve the specification, as&nbsp;well as engage users for feedback to inform development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Open API Initiative is a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project, which are&nbsp;independently funded software projects that harness the power of collaborative&nbsp;development to fuel innovation across industries and ecosystems. By spreading&nbsp;the collaborative DNA of the largest collaborative software development project&nbsp;in history, The Linux Foundation provides the essential collaborative and&nbsp;organizational framework so project hosts can focus on innovation and results.&nbsp;Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects span the enterprise, mobile, embedded&nbsp;and life sciences markets and are backed by many of the largest names in&nbsp;technology.

<p>Member Company Comments:</p>
<p><strong>3Scale</strong><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been firm supporters of Swagger from early on and are excited about the&nbsp;formation of the Linux Foundation OAI and collaboration on the new API&nbsp;definition format,&rdquo; said Steven Willmott, CEO, 3Scale Inc. &ldquo;The new format will be&nbsp;a crucial element to the development of the emerging Web of APIs and we&rsquo;re&nbsp;very much looking forward to contributing to its evolution.&rdquo;</p>
