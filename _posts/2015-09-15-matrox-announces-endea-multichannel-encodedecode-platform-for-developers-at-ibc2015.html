The Matrox Endea&trade; (Encoder and Decoder Appliance) OEM reference platform greatly facilitates the development of purpose-built encoders, decoders, transcoders and video switchers dramatically reducing R&amp;D investment for designers of H.264 encoding and decoding applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The Endea platform makes it easier for our OEM partners to develop a vast array of products built on Matrox core technology for a wide variety of markets,&rdquo; said David Chiappini, vice president of research and development, Matrox Graphics. &ldquo;Our rich libraries provide deep control over product customization and come complete with sample code and dedicated OEM development support. We envision product engineers being able to produce highly specialized applications which can include custom I/O configurations mixed with the unique characteristics of our world-class codec and video processing engines using this highly evolved platform for development.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Endea functionality includes capture, encoding, streaming, recording, switching, video processing, special effects creation, decoding, transcoding, and display. OEMs can use Endea for applications such as video wall controllers, video extension products, video and matrix switchers, multiviewers, encoding appliances for streaming and/or recording, decoding appliances, and communications and collaboration appliances.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Endea OEM reference platform offers advanced features including:</p>
