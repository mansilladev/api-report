<p>Seattle businesses have been long overdue for advanced professional website designer services. Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into people's lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed. Web SEO Master utilizes the latest technology to develop the infrastructure of a website, for individual or company use.</p>
<p><strong>New standards</strong><br />The W3C has released new standards of HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's, each as a new but individual standard. However, while the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and some of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).</p>
<p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the professional website designer (<a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3dlYnNpdGVkZXNpZ25lcnByb2dyYW1tZXIuY29t">http://websitedesignerprogrammer.com</a>) and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of using a variety of languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Flash to create a site, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a professional web designer (<a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3dlYnNlb21hc3Rlci5jb20=">http://webseomaster.com</a>) responsible for the visual aspect alone.</p>
<p>Additional Web SEO Master Professionals that may become involved in the creation of a website include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Graphic designers to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons</li>
<li> Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet</li>
<li> SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines</li>
<li> Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site[1]</li>
<li> User experience (UX) designer incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is only one #1 spot at the top of the search and using &lsquo;off the shelf&rsquo; services will not get a website there anytime soon. The only way that really works is with a unique strategy tailored to the requirements of the business. Web SEO Master can help to create a plan that produces results and fits the budget.</p>
