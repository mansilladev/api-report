<p><a href="http://www.wolterskluwerhealth.com/pages/welcome.aspx">Wolters Kluwer</a>,&nbsp;a leading global provider of information for healthcare professionals and students, announced today that its Clinical Drug Information unit is strengthening support for customers in the Asia Pacific region with the release of the new&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medispan.com%2Fmedispan-clinical%2F&amp;esheet=51065509&amp;newsitemid=20150325005590&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ICD-10-AM+v6+%E2%80%93+Disease+Mapping%E2%84%A2+API&amp;index=2&amp;md5=e132d4b444b8a1ad093728dfeed50f21">ICD-10-AM v6 &ndash; Disease Mapping&trade; API</a>. This essential tool will help facilitate the interoperability required by Australian and other regional customers employing drug data from the Clinical Drug Information application Medi-Span&reg;.</p>
<p>ICD-10 is the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, a medical classification list of codes that identify various diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, and other factors involved in reporting and documenting medical care. The codes, maintained by the World Health Organization, help create a standard international data vocabulary for sharing information and communicating diagnoses and other medical information. ICD-10-AM is the &ldquo;Australian Modification&rdquo; code set, which has been customized and extended to include new codes and conditions relevant in Australia and the surrounding region.</p>
<p>With the ICD-10-AM v6 &ndash; Disease Mapping API, Medi-Span customers in nations such as Australia, Singapore and Saudi Arabia will receive the region-specific data they need to better deliver medication decision support. This new offering is an application programming interface (API) that maps Medi-Span proprietary medical condition codes to the corresponding ICD-10-AM identifiers. This will help improve interoperability and enhance data-driven clinical screenings, including for drug-disease contraindications and condition-specific drug dosing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Healthcare professionals in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the Middle East and throughout Asia Pacific need relevant data to power their processes. They should not be expected to compromise and adapt to codes designed for the United States, Canada, or Europe,&rdquo; stated Steven Kerscher, Vice President &amp; General Manager, Clinical Drug Information, Wolters Kluwer Health, Clinical Solutions. &ldquo;The Clinical Drug Information unit has strong relationships with health systems in the region, and we are proud to provide the data and data mapping those organizations need to optimize their clinical systems and deliver the best possible healthcare.&rdquo;</p>
