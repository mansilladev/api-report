<p>API design platform <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>&nbsp;just&nbsp;announced the launch of <a href="http://enterprise.apiary.io">Apiary for Enterprise</a> -- an offering that helps organizations build uniform APIs across development teams.</p>
<p>With enterprise software development becoming increasingly distributed, consistent API design both within an organization and as a bridge to the outside world has never been more important. Apiary for Enterprise lets teams codify API style guides, automate design monitoring and continuously sync API signatures across the platform.</p>
<p>Apiary for Enterprise builds on Apiary's existing toolchain by adding support for API design assertions, creating a developer-friendly, JavaScript-based language for evaluating API Blueprints. To bootstrap API style guide efforts, Apiary provides a library of API design assertions derived from the API style guides and best practices drawn from a diverse range of customers. Moving forward, the company intends to encourage sharing and community around the API design assertion language, with the goal of making it easy for enterprises to rapidly adopt industry best practices, while encouraging broad interoperability among APIs and applications.</p>
<p>Apiary for Enterprise delivers enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs, premium support options, and enhanced integrations, including support for on-premise installations of Github Enterprise. Apiary for Enterprise is immediately available. Existing customers can seamlessly upgrade from existing plans with no downtime or migration effort.
