<p class="responsiveNews">The PowerSchool ISV Partner Badging System recognizes three integration levels: single sign on, data exchange, and seamless user experience. The Partner Badging System gives customers more information about which ISVs are investing in secure integration to enhance their PowerSchool SIS experience.</p>

Several ISV partners have already achieved certification within the first weeks of the program. These include Blackboard, Canvas by Instructure, Conference Gateway by SRC Solutions, Edge Document Solutions, InfoSnap, Intellimedia, K12Online, LunchTime Software, Naiku, SchoolMessenger, ParentSquare, Registration Gateway by SRC Solutions, On Demand by SRC Solutions, Revtrak, and TIENET.</p>
