<p><a href="http://www.miamire.com">The Miami Association of REALTORS&reg; (MIAMI)</a>, the largest local REALTOR&reg; association in the United States, announced today that its 40,000+ members will be given access to the <a href="http://www.realsatisfied.com">RealSatisfied customer satisfaction platform</a> for collecting evaluations of their performance.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;MIAMI prides itself on providing the best, leading-edge products and services to our members,&rdquo; said Teresa King Kinney, CEO of the MIAMI Association of REALTORS. &ldquo;RealSatisfied will help our members better serve consumers, contributing to enhanced performance and success.  We are excited to add RealSatisfied to our more than 100 premium products and services that position our members to compete and excel in today's market."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">RealSatisfied, a performance evaluation and customer satisfaction platform designed exclusively for the real estate industry, sends customer satisfaction surveys to both home buyer and seller clients on behalf of REALTORS&reg; at the close of transactions. Reminders to send a survey will be triggered automatically at the end of every transaction via an integration with the RealSatisfied API and the MIAMI Real Estate Transaction Standards (RETS) feed, scheduled to go live November 2, 2015.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The evaluation process that MIAMI used was rigorous and thorough,&rdquo; said Jeff Turner, President of RealSatisfied. &ldquo;It has been clear from the beginning that Teresa and her team are serious about bringing only the best products and services to their members. We are excited to have passed the test and look forward to working with them to further the conversation around agent performance and to provide their members with the best experience possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The tools include easy-to-use widgets for MIAMI members to publish client recommendations on their own websites or share those recommendations automatically to third party services. They can also share to their social networks, and provide third party validation of customer satisfaction. &ldquo;The amount of detail contained in the survey responses is substantial,&rdquo; said Teresa King Kinney, &ldquo;we were impressed with the how easy the platform is to use and how simple they have made sharing the customer satisfaction data and testimonials. Their approach to data ownership is refreshing and one that we support.&rdquo;</p>
