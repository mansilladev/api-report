<p class="responsiveNews">CallTrackingMetrics's software tracks calls back to particular advertisements, ad clicks, website visits, and answering agents.

<p class="responsiveNews">Eyal Gershon, one of the founders of Callbox, saw the need for call tracking early on in his days as a developer and digital advertising manager. While he started looking for a solution to track calls back into AdWords to optimize ads, he quickly realized that call tracking uncovers all sorts of issues within a company about how calls are being handled. Simple tools like call recording are a wealth of information for management. They frequently uncover gaps in how often the phone is answered, inconsistent agent performance on the phone, and even situations where calls are being sent to the wrong place in complicated phone systems.</p>
