API architects, app developers, QA testers, QA engineers and DevOps engineers rely on Runscope for in-depth API monitoring and testing, and their goal is to serve any and all teams that publish and consume APIs. Different teams use Runscope for testing across local dev, staging and production environments, and collaboration and deployments should be seamless for everyone. One of the key challenges when working across teams is managing configuration. Today, Runscope is addressing one of their top feature requests: support for multi-environment testing.</p>
