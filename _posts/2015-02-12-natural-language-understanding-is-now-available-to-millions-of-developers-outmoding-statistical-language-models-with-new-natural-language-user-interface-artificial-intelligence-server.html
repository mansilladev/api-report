<p>Millions of developers with only basic programming skills will now be able to create their own Artificial Intelligence (AI) Natural Language Understanding Interfaces (NLUI), with the announcement of today&rsquo;s release of LinguaSys Natural Language User Interface Server. The new, multitenant, NLUI Server runs on Microsoft Azure&rsquo;s open cloud platform, so users can quickly build, deploy and manage applications across a global network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;While our competitors are creating highly proprietary systems that only they can control, at exorbitant pricing levels, we are making NLU a commodity to enhance the customer experience for large and small enterprises around the world&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyone who can write XML scripts can create complex NLU applications such as hotel reservations, car rentals, an NLU interface to a favorite Customer Relation Management (CRM) system or build their own Siri-like application by leveraging LinguaSys&rsquo; extensive semantic network of 20+ languages, and their NLU engine, which moves most of the AI from the developer to the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re revolutionizing the byzantine Natural Language Understanding marketplace by commoditizing the ability to create AI interfaces in hours or days, not months and years,&rdquo; said Brian Garr, CEO of LinguaSys. &ldquo;NLUI Server allows you to write an AI interface once, and have it accept input in all LinguaSys supported languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new NLU capability is available on the LinguaSys GlobalNLP&trade; portal at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnlp.linguasys.com%2F&amp;esheet=51038101&amp;newsitemid=20150211005991&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fnlp.linguasys.com%2F&amp;index=1&amp;md5=663bc33994883d1f9097305087ce9031" target="_blank">https://nlp.linguasys.com/</a>. Trial subscriptions are free, and it comes with an editor, validator and run time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While our competitors are creating highly proprietary systems that only they can control, at exorbitant pricing levels, we are making NLU a commodity to enhance the customer experience for large and small enterprises around the world,&rdquo; said Garr. &ldquo;This is not smoke and mirrors. Try it yourself, today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LinguaSys&rsquo; NLUI Server is the latest addition to its suite of multilingual software offerings included in GlobalNLP&trade;, a cloud-based API publishing platform for developers, announced October 21. GlobalNLP&trade; enables the global software developer population to build Natural Language Processing applications with their own business logic and extract meaning from unstructured or conversational text across languages.&nbsp;</p>
