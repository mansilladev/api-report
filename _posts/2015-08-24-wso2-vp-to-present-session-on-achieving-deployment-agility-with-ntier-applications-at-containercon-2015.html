<p>As containerization moves from lab work to production application projects, teams seek to achieve deployment agility, application resilience, and resource optimization. At ContainerCon 2015, WSO2 Vice President of Platform Evangelism Chris Haddad will explore how teams can containerize production n-tier applications to effectively manage container dependencies and achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ContainerCon 2015 is being held August 17-19, 2015 at the Sheraton Seattle Hotel in Seattle.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The presentation, &ldquo;Bringing N-Tier Applications to Containers,&rdquo; will run 4:00 &ndash; 4:50 p.m. on Tuesday, August 18, 2015 in room Willow A. Chris will begin by discussing how teams are selecting complementary open source projects&mdash;such as Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Apache Mesos and Apache Stratos&mdash;to craft an open source platform that shifts legacy applications away from virtual machines and into containers. He then will demonstrate how teams can effectively manage container dependencies, independently scale container tiers, and deliver quality of service. Additionally, Chris will examine micro-service architecture patterns that are guiding teams toward application packaging strategies and container lifecycle decisions from a developer&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
