<p>As of today, <a href="http://www.coinzone.com.">Coinzone</a> will be providing UK businesses with an array of proven and effective tools including their payment gateway, which was created to give merchants an easy and highly intuitive way to take full advantage of Bitcoin. Risk free Coinzone accounts include no currency exchange risk, and payments instantly convert to GDP, thanks to Coinzone&rsquo;s UK bank partnerships. Free processing for new merchants is available until June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>With Coinzone, more than 5 million businesses in the UK can accept Bitcoin transactions, through an efficient system which offers a proven method for businesses to reach new customers on a global scale. Utilizing Bitcoin provides merchants with a myriad of benefits, which include zero fraud and zero chargebacks.</p>
<p>CEO Manuel Heilmann recently commented on this UK announcement stating, &ldquo;Businesses, merchants, freelancers and contractors alike will find immediate benefits from what Coinzone has to offer. With customers in over 10 countries, we have created a frictionless way for those in the UK to use Bitcoin with their customers and clients. This is a big step in eliminating the complexities and risks so often associated with Bitcoin payments. Coinzone is easy, effective, provides an exceptional user experience and does it all in a highly secure and intuitive fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With support for nearly a dozen languages, the conversion-optimised online payment page is the easiest way to accept Bitcoin in the UK. Selling products is simple via point-of-sale or through mobile by using Coinzone&rsquo;s dual-language mobile apps for both Android and iPhone/iPad.</p>
<p>Also, Coinzone has integrated with the top online shopping carts such as Magento, WooCommerce, Prestashop and others and has built a powerful API for custom solutions. Bitcoin payments can be managed anywhere from the home to the office and beyond, due to Coinzone&rsquo;s dashboard and reporting tools. Recently Coinzone has also expanded its offering to include a new invoicing feature, which allows freelancers, contractors and others to accept Bitcoin when invoicing their clients.</p>
