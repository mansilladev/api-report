<p><a href="http://www.mckesson.com/">McKesson</a> today announced that it will exhibit a new organization-wide content management tool, OneContent&trade;, during HIMSS15 in Chicago, April 12-16. OneContent delivers enterprise-wide data in a single, centralized system designed for efficient hospital workflow, regardless of the electronic health records (EHR) system or document management products in place. The solution addresses content storage challenges that customers face regarding health information management (HIM) and enterprise-wide data overload.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;The Cost of Managing Paper: A Great Incentive to Go Paperless!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As a single solution for the enterprise, it helps reduce total cost of ownership associated with system and vendor complexity while simplifying administrative and system overhead,&rdquo; said Patrick Gardner, vice president of product management, Enterprise Information Solutions, McKesson Technology Solutions. &ldquo;It also helps optimize workflow and knowledge worker productivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OneContent, built with open API integration and HTML5 functionality, enables information agility across the enterprise, supporting customer flexibility and growth&mdash;regardless of which other vendor systems are used for EHR or document management. For current McKesson customers, OneContent consolidates McKesson Patient Folder&trade; and Enterprise Content Manager&trade; to achieve a consistent, stable, cost-effective content strategy.</p>
<p>Outside of HIM data, hospital information from disparate departments requires extensive data storage, transmittal and application. Fractured content management approaches are not only disruptive to an organization&rsquo;s valuable EHR strategy, they are costly from operational and administrative perspectives. The typical enterprise with 1000 knowledge workers will incur $2.5M to $3.5M in annual expense managing paper documentation, according to IDC, a market intelligence firm.<span>1</span>&nbsp;OneContent streamlines the process of content storage, transmittal and integration for smoother access and improved ROI, driving value across the enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This solution gives customers the ability to put the right content in the right place at the right time, all to the betterment of organizational productivity and efficiency,&rdquo; said Gardner.</p>
