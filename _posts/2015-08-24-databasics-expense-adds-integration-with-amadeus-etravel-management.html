<p><a href="http://www.data-basics.com">DATABASICS</a>, the standard for employee reporting, announced that it has successfully integrated its expense reporting solution, DATABASICS Expense, with Amadeus&rsquo; corporate travel booking tool, Amadeus e-Travel Management (&ldquo;AeTM&rdquo;). With this integration, itinerary information produced in the AeTM system flows seamlessly into DATABASICS where it is matched with credit card and receipt information. Not only will the integration minimize data entry by the traveler, but it will provide management enhanced data for reporting and benchmarking, including &ldquo;booked vs. actual&rdquo; analysis. Combined with DATABASICS&rsquo; tight integration with leading accounting systems, the DATABASICS/AeTM integration will offer true end-to-end travel and expense management.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Marcel Syriani, DATABASICS CTO, &ldquo;We are excited about offering the market this new, powerful option for booking and expense reporting interaction. Open systems integration allows organizations to pick the most appropriate solution for each component of the expense management value chain and we are convinced that organizations seeking high levels of efficiency, control and ease-of-use will find compelling what we are offering here. Amadeus&rsquo; approach to integration worked well with the API we developed for similar, prior booking tool integrations. We look forward to working with Amadeus and those travel management companies who use AeTM.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">DATABASICS integration with Amadeus AeTM has been received enthusiastically by travel management companies. &ldquo;Atlas Travel is proud to partner with DATABASICS and Amadeus eTravel Management to bring our clients new choices in expense management and reporting,&rdquo; said Lea Cahill, Chief Operating Officer at Atlas Travel &amp; Technology Group. &ldquo;DATABASICS&rsquo; integration with AeTM provides further opportunities to offer solutions and services that best meet the needs of our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Aladdin Travel&rsquo;s President, Richard Shore observed, &ldquo;DATABASICS Expense and AeTM, is a powerful combination. Our customers do like choices, it is our job to add value to those choices and we continue to see Amadeus is very committed to bringing technology alternatives to their TMC partners and corporate clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Regarding the DATABASICS integration, Jay Richmond, Head of Corporate Product &amp; Innovation for Amadeus North America, stated, &ldquo;Amadeus is excited to offer an additional option for companies looking to gain efficiencies in their travel program by integrating AeTM with DATABASICS. The speed and commitment DATABASICS demonstrated to launch this capability is a testament of their ability to adapt to meet the needs of their customers and partners.
