<p><a href="http://www.cavium.com">Cavium, Inc.</a>, (NASDAQ:&nbsp;<a title="CAVM" rel="nofollow" href="http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=CAVM" target="_blank">CAVM</a>), a leading provider of semiconductor products that enable intelligent processing for enterprise, data center, wired and wireless networking, will demonstrate its single-chip OCTEON III processor running a full IPsec security application at 100Gbps throughput, necessary for next generation LTE-A and 5G networks using standard OpenDataPlane (ODP) software API's at Mobile World Congress 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure transport throughput requirements in wireless networks are growing exponentially, creating the need for much higher performance processors with advanced security acceleration in next-generation equipment.&nbsp; The Cavium OCTEON III 48-core 64-bit CN78xx processor is ideally suited for use in 4G/LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) equipment including Mobility Management Entity (MME), Serving Gateways (SGW) and Packet Data Network Gateways (PGW), providing a 2.5X increase over previously-available performance levels and offering close to bare-metal silicon performance while utilizing standard software API's. OpenDataPlane applications are supported across Cavium's multi-core processor product lines including OCTEON and ThunderX&trade;.</p>
<p>Cavium has worked closely with Linaro to support the new OpenDataPlane initiative and has expanded support to the new OCTEON III processor line as well as the ThunderX family of processors. The OCTEON III CN78XX family of multi-core MIPS64 processors builds on the award-winning OCTEON family, with up to 48 next generation cnMIPS64 cores, a wide range of I/O, higher application acceleration for networking, security and storage, larger caches, high speed interfaces such as DDR4 and PCIe Gen3, and multi-chip coherent connectivity using Cavium Coherent Processor Interconnect (CCPI) for enabling high performance applications.</p>
<p>Cavium has been a Linaro member since 2012 when it joined the Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG). Cavium expanded its Linaro membership in 2013 when it joined the Linaro Networking Group (LNG). Cavium's engineers are active contributors to multiple Linaro projects and Cavium has representation on the Technical Steering Committee for both LEG and LNG.</p>
<p>"OpenDataPlane will allow Cavium customers to run their dataplane applications on a wide range of our processors", said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Raghib Hussain</span>, Corporate VP/GM and CTO. "The ability to write applications once and then use them on many different processors and architectures is very appealing and since it is backed by a true open standards body, customers will not be locked into legacy architectures."</p>
<p><strong>OpenDataplane.org<br /></strong>The OpenDataPlane project is an open-source, cross-platform set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for the networking data plane. ODP embraces and extends existing proprietary, optimized vendor-specific hardware blocks and software libraries to provide interoperability with minimal overhead. Initially defined by members of the Linaro Networking Group (LNG), this project is open to contributions from all individuals and companies who share an interest in promoting a standard set of APIs to be used across the full range of network processor architectures available.</p>
<p><strong>Linaro<br /></strong>Linaro is a not-for-profit engineering organization with over 180 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation.</p>
<p>To ensure commercial grade software, Linaro executes comprehensive test and validation on member hardware platforms. The full scope of Linaro's engineering work is open to all online.
