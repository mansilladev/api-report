<p><a href="https://vatboss.com/">VAT Boss</a>&nbsp;is a new Software as a Service platform designed to make it easier for businesses to comply with the new EU VAT Place of Supply Rules which came into effect on 1st January 2015. The rulings mean that any business that sells digital products and services to consumers electronically within in the EU will have to charge VAT based on the location of their customer, as opposed to the location of the business (seller), which used to be the case.</p>
<p>To help comply with this, a scheme known as VAT MOSS (VAT Mini One Stop Shop) was created which will send the VAT charges to the individual countries on a business&rsquo;s behalf. However, a business must provide two non-conflicting pieces of evidence proving the customers location such as an IP or billing address and they must store that data for 10 years.</p>
<p>This is a challenging prospect for many businesses who may be unsure of how to collect, record and identify the locations of their customers. This could require significant administrative effort better spent focusing on growing their business.</p>
<p>We want to help take the stress out of theses changes and have designed VAT Boss to make it easier for companies to comply so they can keep trading in the EU. The service will allow a business to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the correct VAT rate to apply given location evidence.</li>
<li>Validate location evidence, such as ensuring VAT numbers are legitimate when&nbsp;&nbsp;supplying businesses, geo-locating IP addresses, validating phone number locations.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Store VAT evidence for reporting.</li>
<li>Generate VAT reports for regulatory compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The service uses a simple REST API (Application Programming Interface) which can be integrated into a website with relatively small effort. Sign up to VAT Boss now for a free 30 day trial.</span></p>
<p><strong>About Us</strong><br />VAT Boss is a product of Code Qualified LLP- a small software company which has been around since 2014. We created VAT Boss for our own use when we learnt of the upcoming changes to VAT Place of Supply Rules. Realising that we may not be the only ones who could use some automated help with complying we decided to make it available as a service.</p>
