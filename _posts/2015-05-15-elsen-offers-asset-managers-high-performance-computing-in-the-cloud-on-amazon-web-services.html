<p><a href="http://www.elsen.co">Elsen, Inc.</a>, the Boston-based financial technology firm, is leveraging the unique benefits of cloud infrastructure from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accelerate processing of complex time-series calculations for institutional investors.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations and other algorithms widely run in financial services for backtesting, pricing and risk management are ideally suited to cloud computing. They require high bandwidth and high throughput but for limited periods of time. Cloud-based High Performance Computing is a cost-effective solution for throughput-oriented applications.</p>
<p>Running the Accelerated Computing Engine in the AWS Cloud allows Elsen to offer clients instant availability and the ability to scale up and down rapidly. Elsen sets up a private secure configuration for the client in the cloud, ingests and stores the data in the configuration and then offers its Accelerated Computing Engine via a RESTful API. End customers get all the computing power they need, whenever they need it, with no long-term commitment and no up-front expenses. They pay only for the computing power they use and have this power available to them on-demand. No more processing data on weekends or at night. Quant strategists are no longer restricted in terms of developing, optimizing an executing their rules-based/algo strategies.</p>
<p>For calculations that require it, Elsen utilizes GPU acceleration. Time series calculations are ideally suited for GPU acceleration because they can be massively run in parallel. With thousands of high-performance processing cores, GPU accelerators excel at speeding up these calculations. AWS supports GPU acceleration with servers that have been specifically engineered to scale to tens of thousands of instances on demand.</p>
<p>Hedge fund managers continually seek a competitive advantage by leveraging technology, but the trend is away from large capital expenditures. &ldquo;Hedge fund managers are adopting hosted technology solutions in increasing numbers. In particular, they are outsourcing the infrastructure needed to develop new products and strategies, while still retaining control over their IP,&rdquo; said Havell Rodrigues, Elsen&rsquo;s CRO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AWS offers cloud infrastructure that enables customers of all sizes around the world to access benefits like scalability, reliability and agility. Benefits like these, combined with AWS&rsquo;s inherent security capabilities, provide customers in fields like financial services with an ideal solution for their IT needs,&rdquo; said Matt Wood, General Manager, Data Science at Amazon Web Services, Inc. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to see Elsen&rsquo;s use of AWS to enable its Accelerated Computing Engine, bringing the value of the AWS Cloud to its hedge fund, bank and insurance company customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsen recently took an in-depth look at the comparisons between proprietary in-house systems and cloud-based solutions in a discussion paper entitled In-House Versus The Cloud, available here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbHNlbi5jby9kaXNjdXNzaW9u">https://elsen.co/discussion</a>.</p>
