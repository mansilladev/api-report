<p><a href="http://www.totalphase.com">Total Phase</a>, a leading provider of embedded systems development tools, is pleased to announce the release of SPI Active - Level 2, a new application, for its Promira&trade; Serial Platform. This is the third application release of the many outlined in the roadmap for the Promira platform. SPI Active - Level 2 increases the capabilities of the Promira platform, making it stronger, faster and smarter than any other single protocol analyzer and host adapter on the market.</p>
<p>SPI Active &ndash; Level 2 Application features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protocols Supported: SPI Single, Dual I/O</li>
<li>Master Clock Speed: 40 MHz</li>
<li>Slave Clock Speed: 20 MHz</li>
<li>Chip/Slave Select: 3</li>
<li>GPIO(s): up to 12</li>
<li>Voltage Levels: 0.9-3.45, 5</li>
<li>Target Power: 2 independent, 1 programmable (0.9-3.45 V), 1 switchable (3.3-5 V), 100 mA each</li>
<li>Variable word length</li>
<li>Connection Types: High Speed USB,  Ethernet 10/100</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;SPI Active - Level 2, the latest application released for the Promira Serial Platform supports higher clock rates, increases functionality, and expands the overall versatility of the Promira Serial Platform,&rdquo; said Gil Ben-Dov, CEO of Total Phase.  &ldquo;Our goal, when designing the Promira Serial Platform was to accelerate the embedded development process by focusing on the needs of the embedded engineer. And we have with &ndash; advanced emulation capabilities to help reduce hardware iterations; integrated level shifting and high performance master/slave functionality makes for quicker work programming and easier debugging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Promira platform replaces disparate devices on the engineer&rsquo;s workbench with one single versatile and powerful device. It currently supports both the I2C and SPI protocols through a USB or Ethernet connection. Applications can be added on the fly; providing engineers with the flexibility to purchase only the functionality they need, when they need it.</p>
<p>The Promira Serial Platform with the SPI Active - Level 2 can be used in any number of industries for a variety of applications.</p>
<p>Industries: Automotive, communications, computer accessories, defense, electronic, health, manufacturing, medical, retail, safety, semiconductor</p>
<p>Applications: Design, development, End-of-line programming, manufacturing, memory chip programming, peripheral simulation, test and measurement</p>
<p>Customers using the SPI Active &ndash; Level 2 Application features have this to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Simple to use, was able to navigate and perform the SPI tests with ease.&rdquo;  - Systems Architect, Acevista Inc.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Able to program the SPI interfaces at much higher speeds then the Aardvark.&rdquo; - Master Inventor, IBM</li>
<li>&ldquo;Great I2C/SPI tooling. Very helpful in my debugging.&rdquo; - Engineer, Worcester Polytechnic Institute</li>
<li>&ldquo;Using the Promira device, keep up the good work.&rdquo; - Principal System Engineer, Raytheon Missile Systems</li>
</ul>
