<p><a href="http://www.fintechsandbox.org">FinTech Sandbox</a>, created to streamline access to data for financial technology startups, today announced that <a href="http://www.elsen.co">Elsen</a>, one of the program&rsquo;s first companies, is using global securities datasets from FactSet to massively accelerate financial calculations.</p>
<p>Elsen provides financial services firms with the ability to run more complex simulations on more data faster and at lower cost. According to Zac Sheffer, co-founder and CEO of Elsen, &ldquo;One of the greatest impediments for FinTech startups is the high cost or inaccessibility of financial data. FinTech Sandbox streamlined the entire process, shrinking the time required to secure access to data from months to a week or less. We were using sample data sets from FactSet in a matter of days. They were just incredibly helpful to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FactSet is a leading provider of integrated global financial information and analytical applications for the investment community, and a FinTech Sandbox data partner. Said David Murdock, FactSet&rsquo;s Vice President of Content &amp; Technology Solutions, &ldquo;We are excited to be a data partner of the FinTech Sandbox and thrilled to be working with innovative startups like Elsen. It is great to see this community coming together and we look forward to supporting Elsen as a member of the program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FinTech Sandbox offers a 6-month program providing:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A robust set of data feeds and APIs from a wide array of data partners,</li>
<li>Cloud hosting from industry-leading infrastructure partners,</li>
<li>Membership in a vibrant, global FinTech community, and</li>
<li>Some limited space for co-working and events.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sandbox doesn&rsquo;t require any equity from participating startups &ndash; in fact, the program is entirely free. Says Jean Donnelly, Executive Director of the program, "What we ask is that entrepreneurs give back in-kind to the FinTech community. We ask that they share what they learn with each other, provide product feedback to our data partners, and contribute non-proprietary code or data mapping schemas to the FinTech community."</p>
<p>Adds Donnelly, &ldquo;At the Sandbox, we are very excited when we can introduce innovative new companies with an industry leading data provider. Both groups are so enthusiastic in exploring the ways they can work together."</p>
