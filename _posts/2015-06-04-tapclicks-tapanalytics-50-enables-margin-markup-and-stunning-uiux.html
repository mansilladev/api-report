With the TapAnalytics platform, marketers can automatically generate and view results, reports, key performance metrics, and deep analytics in an integrated environment.</p>
<p>New features in TapAnalytics 5.0 include:</p>
<p>Markup and Margin Calculations for Digital Advertising Campaign Tools</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> TapAnalytics presents agencies and businesses with information on the cost and effectiveness of their marketing activities.  Agencies and publishers routinely apply an &ldquo;agency fee&rdquo; to the base fulfillment cost, so the numbers retrieved from digital marketing services generally don&rsquo;t reflect the client&rsquo;s true cost.  TapClicks customers have requested the ability to display this Agency Cost to their end-customers based on the application of a markup or margin amount to the base fulfillment cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved Navigation</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> As TapAnalytics has grown in features and capability, TapAnalytics has enhanced the navigation structure to better reflect how options are used.</li>
<li> The Logout, My Account and Help options have moved up to beneath the logo, since the presentation and control of data is the primary objective. It provides more data before the user needs to scroll vertically. </li>
<li> The &ldquo;Connect a Service&rdquo; button has been streamlined and changed to &ldquo;Manage Services&rdquo; and grouped with logout, account and help options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved Reporting and Charting</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> The PDF exporter has been standardized across &ldquo;Generate Client Report&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scheduled Reports&rdquo; for more consistent performance</li>
<li> A graph on/off toggle has been added to allow user control of graphs in reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>"TapClicks is 100% dedicated to being as responsive as possible to our customers&rsquo; needs,&rdquo; commented Michael Mertz, VP of Product Management at TapClicks.  &ldquo;These new features and integrations are specifically requested by customers, and will greatly enhance how our customers work with their clients.  We believe TapAnalytics 5.0 is just the beginning of a paradigm shift in marketing technology.&rdquo;</p>
