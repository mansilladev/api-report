The process includes a &ldquo;Prioritize&rdquo; phase, where the DragonSpears&rsquo; team collaborates with the client organization&rsquo;s team to create a leaner process by focusing on  <br />the essentials needed to reach the ROI factors; that is prioritizing the development to deliver the &lsquo;first step&rsquo; application, proof points, and phased builds.</p>
