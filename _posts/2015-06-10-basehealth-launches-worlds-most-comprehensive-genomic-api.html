<p><a href="http://www.basehealth.com/"> BaseHealth</a>, the precision health and medicine company, today announced the launch of the BaseHealth API, a set of five calls that gives developers the ability to integrate genomic data and comprehensive health assessments into their health and wellbeing applications. The API adds genomic precision to any modern health and wellbeing offering.</p>
<p>The BaseHealth API is built on the BaseHealth assessment engine, which leverages genomic data in combination with clinical and behavioral analysis to provide personalized, evidence-based health assessments. The assessment engine is backed by 5 years of extensive chronic disease research and modeled on validated data from over 20,000 peer-reviewed papers. It currently includes data on specific risk factors for more than 40 common complex diseases as well as information on 17 drug responses and 9 food responses, with more research being added to the platform regularly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The BaseHealth API marks the first time in human history that genomic data is on-call for developers across the globe,&rdquo; said Prakash Menon, CEO of BaseHealth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re putting these services in the hands of developers who will use them to dramatically improve outcomes, drive better patient-centered care, and manage risk on the individual and population level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are five initial services offered to developers with the BaseHealth API:</p>
<p>Anonymous Assessment - input a subject&rsquo;s genetic, diet, lifestyle, and environmental information and BaseHealth returns a risk profile for that subject for a requested disease, including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Disease risk level at age 65 </li>
<li> Current odds for the disease</li>
<li> Achievable odds for the disease</li>
<li> List of risk factors for each disease and the odds associated with each risk factor</li>
</ul>
<p>Curated Content - input the name of a disease and BaseHealth returns information about the disease that includes:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Associated genes/variants</li>
<li> Risk factors ordered based on their impact on the disease</li>
<li> Actions that could reduce the disease risk</li>
<li> Statistics about the disease and its prevalence</li>
</ul>
<p>Drug Response - input genetic variations and BaseHealth returns information on drug response analysis including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Effect of the genotype (e.g. Average, Increased, Decreased)</li>
<li> Attribute that the genotype effects (e.g. Drug effect in lowering blood pressure)</li>
<li> The number of variations that contribute to this effect</li>
<li> The list of variations that contribute to this effect</li>
<li> The ethnicity on which this effect is found</li>
</ul>
<p>Food Response - input genetic variations and BaseHealth returns food response analysis including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Effect of the genotype (e.g. Average, Increased, Decreased)</li>
<li> Attribute that the genotype effects (e.g. Vitamin D Levels)</li>
<li> The number of variations that contribute to this effect</li>
<li> The list of variations that contribute to this effect</li>
<li> The ethnicity on which this effect is found</li>
</ul>
<p>Personalized Assessment - returns various types of information about members already on the BaseHealth platform with the members&rsquo; authorization</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a remarkable moment in the world of precision medicine,&rdquo; said Hossein Fakhrai-Rad, Chief Scientific Officer and Founder of BaseHealth. &ldquo;The launch of the BaseHealth API opens the floodgate for innovation across the healthcare ecosystem. Developers in healthcare now have the world&rsquo;s most robust health assessment engine at their fingertips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BaseHealth API is free up to 1,000 calls per month. Above 1,000 calls, the cost begins at $0.10 per call and decreases based on volume.</p>
<p>The BaseHealth API is available to developers everywhere starting today. To learn more, visit: <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXIuYmFzZWhlYWx0aC5jb20v">https://developer.basehealth.com/</a>.</p>
