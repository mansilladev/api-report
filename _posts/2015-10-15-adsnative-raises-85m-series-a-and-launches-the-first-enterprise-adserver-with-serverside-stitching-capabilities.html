<p><a href="http://www.adsnative.com"><img src="http://api.report/images/kinlane/adsnative-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Today <a href="http://www.adsnative.com">AdsNative</a>, the modern ad stack for savvy publishers, is pleased to announce that they closed a Series A funding round at $8.5 million. The round was led by Rakuten Ventures and Interwest Partners in addition to Onset Ventures.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new capital will support the launch of AdsNative Enterprise, a platform that integrates an open and flexible ad serving technology within the framework of a publisher&rsquo;s existing content management system (CMS). Media companies have struggled to find all-in-one solutions that support non-standard advertising placements across digital channels and now are facing a new challenge of slow page/app load in addition to the rise of ad-blocking software. AdsNative Enterprise software allows publishers flexible native placements and optimization tools&gt; proven to drive revenue. The &lsquo;server-side stitching&rsquo; technology included in the Enterprise software addresses slow page load times and ad-blocking, by inserting ads at the CMS level rather than making a separate call for ad delivery.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;âPublishers are becoming multi-channel. They are no longer operating single destinations and .com sites. Their content is everywhere across many formats - smartphones, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Roku, Snapchat, Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News App and many more. They are questioning the future of ad serving as they transition to become content channels. âWe are excited to expand our state-of-the-art ad serving technology to support modern publishers so they can manage their revenue at scale without compromising quality for consumers in this journey,&rdquo; stated Satish Polisetti and Dhawal Mujumdar, co-founders of AdsNative.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AdNative Enterprise launches with media partners Disqus, Politico and We Heart It who reach a combined audience of over 1 billion per month. These digital publishers have found that managing multiple tag-based servers and fragmented revenue sources is much too time intensive to scale their business, however, building an entire in-house ad system is very expensive. AdsNative Enterprise allows publishers an all-in-one solution to solve these issues and allows them to focus on their business of creating great content.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;AdsNative has been a fantastic partner to work with as we scale our advertising business. We saved over four months of development time, which was 80% of the projected timeline of creating an in-house advertising solution. AdsNative has robust native ad serving APIs which made it extremely simple for us to integrate them into our CMS, while ensuring a great ad experience for our users and the flexibility for future customization needs&rdquo; -- Sonja Erickson, VP of Operations at We Heart It</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AdsNative also plans to expand further into Asia and mobile with lead investor Rakuten Ventures. As of September 2015, they have already tripled revenue from 2014 and grown the team from 10 to 23 employees.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We started AdsNative with the belief that a great user experience can co-exist with effective monetization for publishers &ndash; these are not orthogonal. As we move from the desktop to mobile internet, AdsNative has developed technology that achieves the trifecta of great user experience, high publisher monetization and better advertiser ROI. We are excited by the vote of confidence from our customers and we welcome our new partners at Rakuten Ventures to help us scale.&rdquo; - Keval Desai, Partner, Interwest Partners</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are very honored and happy to have the opportunity to work with AdsNative. As the ad industry consistently matures and migrates to more seamless integration with content, we believe that AdsNative touches one of the cores of where Ad Tech should be for publishers and advertisers in the next five years.&rdquo; - SaeMin Ahn, Managing Partner, Rakuten Ventures</p>
