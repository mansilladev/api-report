<p><a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a>, the leading log management and analytics service built for the cloud, today announced a new integration with Elasticsearch's&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://logstash.net/" target="_blank">Logstash</a>, the popular open source solution for managing logs and event data. The new integration enables users to easily forward logs collected via Logstash into the cloud-based Logentries service for more meaningful analysis and visualization over time. Similarly the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://logentries.com/product/open-api/" target="_blank">Logentries Open API</a>&nbsp;allows easy extraction of data from the cloud service for Logstash users, promoting interoperability between both solutions.</p>
<p>"It is important for our Ops teams to be able to integrate as many tools as we can to improve performance and time to resolution for our users," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Stephen Keeler</span>, IT Manager at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fusebill.com/" target="_blank">Fusebill.com</a>. "The Logentries and Elasticsearch integration brings together two great logging services and enables me to collect, normalize and perform transformations on these events using Logstash in my on premise environment and then do real-time analysis and troubleshooting using Logentries cloud service."</p>
<p>The Logentries and Elasticsearch integration offers an easy, automated configuration for sending Logstash log data into the Logentries service where users can immediately start to tag, search, and visualize in real-time. For existing Logstash users, the plug-in provides an easy way to take advantage of both solutions for storage and analysis; forwarding key data to Logentries when real time analysis and notification is required, but also taking advantage of the open source model and the Logstash data transformation pipeline. In order to<a rel="nofollow" href="https://logentries.com/doc/logstash/" target="_blank">get started with the integration</a>&nbsp;users need:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Logstash downloaded and configured on a machine&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/tutorials/getting-started-with-logstash" target="_blank">Getting Started Guide</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></li>

<p>"Dev and IT Ops teams today are combining popular tools within their toolkits to help achieve visibility into their cloud, on-prem and hybrid environments," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Trevor Parsons</span>, Chief Scientist and Founder at Logentries. "At Logentries we recognize the importance of an open architecture that allows these teams to easily connect their tools and systems together, and we continue to work with our partners to make it as easy as possible."</p>
<p>The cloud-based Logentries service collects and pre-processes log events in real-time for on-demand analysis, alerting and visualization. With custom tagging and filtering, users can correlate data across their infrastructure to better understand application usage and performance, security issues, and user behavior.
