<p>Local governments in Australia have been quick to follow the lead of those overseas in implementing technology that delivers stable and secure network and communications capabilities that support their diverse activities.</p>
<p>Initially most councils selecting Extreme Networks&rsquo; solutions are situated in Victoria. Like their overseas counterparts, they have been able to maintain and upgrade their new networks without halting operations. According to the company&rsquo;s Systems Engineering Manager, Andrew Kernebone, Australian local government authorities are benefiting from both wired and wireless network reliability and capabilities, and deriving good returns on their investments.</p>
<p>Although Extreme is a carrier/telco grade vendor, its wireless solutions do not carry the price premium of competing vendors. Extreme&rsquo;s solutions have been adopted by a number of local councils who moved from vendors that might have been lower priced, but whose solutions were not as reliable or capable.</p>
<p>Wyndham City Council moved its switching gear from an installation that was reaching the end of its life and support, and suffering problems of performance and reliability. The Council sought technology that delivered enterprise performance at a competitive price, and Extreme&rsquo;s solution was preferred.</p>
<p>Subsequently the council also deployed Extreme&rsquo;s IdentiFi wireless solution. Today Wyndham enjoys a reliable, easy to manage network infrastructure that allows officers to deliver services to residents and business partners.</p>
<p>Knox City Council has used Extreme&rsquo;s switching technology for many years. The IT team saw their data centre refresh as an opportunity to test the market for a best-value solution. Extreme&rsquo;s partner Thomas Duryea offered a best-of-breed open standard solution built around Extreme switches and based on HP compute with EMC storage. This was preferred over the other shortlisted solution built solely around HP.</p>
<p>Another long term Extreme switching user, also in Victoria, recently selected IdentiFi for an initial wireless deployment in their corporate environment. Council continues to utilise Extreme switches for all refreshes and expansion.</p>
<p>The council enjoys a stable infrastructure featuring excellent reliability and product longevity, especially with their BlackDiamond core switches. These were refreshed recently with the latest version of line cards. The network team also appreciate the unified Netsight management of all components and the ability to add access control through NAC. A possible project in future could be the addition of analytics capabilities to provide further network intelligence.</p>
<p>All three councils have expressed their satisfaction with Extreme Networks&rsquo; technology.</p>
<p>Kernebone said: &ldquo;Our is an open standards, open approach. We offer Australia&rsquo;s local government authorities interoperability with the big players such as HP, EMC, VMware and others, without lock-in to a particular vendor&rsquo;s proprietary approach.&rdquo; End-to-end solution</p>
<p>Extreme&rsquo;s ExtremeXOS switching and Identifi wireless combined with Netsight for network management provides an end-to-end solution for local government. Overseas, City of Bellevue, in Washington, has implemented MS Lync from Extreme to improve services and efficiency, while City of Thousand Oaks, in California, has introduced wireless access for 500 employees and residents at five locations. City of Elgin, in Illinois, achieved around-the-clock network resiliency, uptime and performance with Extreme Networks technology after retiring 65 Cisco switches.</p>
<p>In Germany, the Bavarian State Parliament supports bring-your-own-device (BYOD) with an efficient and secure network. The Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior ensured data centre reliability, throughput and ease of administration.</p>
<p>Key enablers for local governments include the ultra-fast 802.11ac wireless network standard introduced recently, and Extreme Networks&rsquo; 3865 802.11ac WLAN outdoor access point, a key addition to the IdentiFi Wireless LAN portfolio. IdentiFi has become the most complete and scalable enterprise Wi-Fi solution addressing both indoor and outdoor wireless connectivity.</p>
<p>Switching and routing gear, which forms the basis of any network, includes the unique CoreFlow2 architecture delivers tens of millions of flows for deep visibility and control. Adaptive networks begin with convergence-ready, modular and standalone switch family that provides high-performance scalability along with granular visibility and control over users, services, and applications to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s applications.</p>
<p>Optimised for use with key technologies including voice and video, virtualisation and cloud computing, <a href="http://www.extremenetworks.com/product/s-series">Extreme&rsquo;s S-Series&reg;</a> is robust and flexible enough to support the ever-changing landscape of today&rsquo;s connectivity and enterprise environments. NetSight network management software delivers visibility and control from core to edge, and is able to manage and automate an entire network through a single interface. An open and published application programming interface (API) allows a network to scale seamlessly, even with components from other vendors.</p>
<p>Purview analytics deliver insights to improve decision-making, improve user experience, and optimise application performance. Purview also detects any malicious use of applications on the network.</p>
<p><strong>Holistic View of Security</strong><br />High availability ensures delivery of security information and event management (SIEM) data, giving a holistic view of a council&rsquo;s technology security. Automatic failover and full disk replication. Delivers threat and log management, compliance reporting, and increased operational efficiency.</p>
<p>For local authorities requiring Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) communications, Extreme&rsquo;s Microsoft Lync implementations are easily deployed and deliver excellent user experiences. They feature quality of service (QoS) over wired, wireless and SDN networks, unified end-to-end management, and granular network and application visibility. IdentiFi wireless has proved to be the most scalable Wireless solution available. The technology has grown and evolved for over a decade with an extensive and diversified customer base. IdentiFi delivers a user experience at unmatched scale and density.</p>
<p>Extreme Networks is setting a new standards for local government for customer experience by delivering network-powered innovation and market leading service and support. The company&rsquo;s high-performance switching and routing products for data centre and core-to-edge networks, wired/wireless LAN access, and unified network management and control.</p>
<p>Larger local authorities are looking at the company&rsquo;s software-defined networking (SDN) and cloud solutions, while all are interested in Extreme&rsquo;s high-density Wi-Fi, BYOD and enterprise mobility, identity access management and security.</p>
