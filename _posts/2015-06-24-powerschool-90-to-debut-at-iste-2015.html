<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;PowerSchool 9.0 is one of the most solid and stable releases I've seen. We have a lot of customizations, so I usually approach a major new release with a bit of apprehension, but PowerSchool 9.0 pretty much just works. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly; the new data visualization and export frameworks provide the seeds for exciting new growth. PowerSchool just keeps getting better with each new release,&rdquo; said Jeremy Davis-Vollrath, PowerSchool Administrator at California State Special Schools.</p>

PowerSchool Registration, available as an option with PowerSchool 9.0, is a self-service module that provides online enrollment and registration capabilities in the core product.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;With 40 million regular users we know how important PowerSchool is to the lives of learners, parents, and education professionals,&rdquo; said Bryan MacDonald, managing director, School Systems. &ldquo;The new features in PowerSchool extend and expand the student information system&rsquo;s capabilities with robust, easy-to-use tools to more effectively manage school processes and student data, and, ultimately, achieve the critical goal of improving learning and teaching.&rdquo;</p>
