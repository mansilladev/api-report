<p><a href="http://www.cendynarcaneo.com/">Cendyn Arcaneo&reg;</a>, the new developer of Metron&reg; and leading hospitality and event technology firm, is excited to announce the release of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cendynarcaneo.com/getregistered/">getregistered&reg;</a>, an enterprise web-based solution engineered to streamline all facets of event registration while increasing ROE (Return on Event). Through its intuitive architecture, getregistered simplifies the complex event registration process, allowing planners to globally execute and measure event registration while enhancing the attendee experience and promoting engagement.</p>
<p>Priced simply as a one-time cost based on single or multi event usage, getregistered&reg; is cost effective and cutting-edge. Designed by expert planners, getregistered&rsquo;s comprehensive dashboard seamlessly integrates all components needed to execute event registration into a single user-friendly solution that offers intelligent design, a highly adoptable interface, customizable features, advanced reporting capabilities, real-time communication and 24/7 secure access.</p>
<p>Identifying that event registration should satisfy both attendees and organizers, getregistered&reg; approaches the process from two angles. The first incorporates a stylish and clean front end which is aesthetically pleasing to an attendee yet easy-to-use and highly informative. The ability to login on any platform from any device to manage a registration or get real-time updates on the event also gives the attendee a one-stop location for all their event needs.<br />Offering event planners a powerful, yet simple, dashboard embodies the second part of getregistered&reg;. With a wide range of functionality, the getregistered dashboard enables the event planner to easily manage all data and attendee information. Features include: dynamic custom reporting in a matter of clicks, full export capabilities of any report or attendee information, permissions-based access for event stakeholders to access as much or as little information as an organizer needs them to have and real-time updates 24/7. All of this functionality is contained within a highly secure (PCI compliant) online environment and is accessible from any computer or mobile device.</p>
<p>As a part of Cendyn Arcaneo&rsquo;s&reg; comprehensive event technology platform that delivers the tools needed to plan, source, manage and measure events on a global scale, getregistered offers a robust solution that is highly customizable and adaptable for events of every size. This dynamic solution is API-friendly, enabling integration possibilities with new or existing micro-sites and other existing event software including a number of the attendee facing applications currently available today. getregistered&reg; will be integrated with Cendyn Arcaneo&reg;&rsquo;s Metron&reg; strategic meetings management system as well as getplanning&reg;, the industry leader in collaborative event planning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to release getregistered&reg; to the public,&rdquo; said Jon Summersfield, Executive Vice President of Cendyn Arcaneo. &ldquo;This simple and stylish but highly effective registration system reaffirms our commitment to streamlining every aspect of an event from all sides - planner or attendee.&rdquo; Summersfield adds, &ldquo;Our method of pricing shows that we have listened to the consumers who don&rsquo;t want registration costs to come with parameters and restrictions such as limiting the number of registrations or include per attendee pricing. We simply believe there&rsquo;s a better way and have delivered on that.&rdquo;</p>
