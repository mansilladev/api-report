<p><a href="http://www.freezerworks.com/"><img class="newsImage" style="padding: 15px;" src="http://api.report/images/kinlane/freezer-works-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="http://www.freezerworks.com/">Freezerworks</a> today announces the release of Freezerworks 2015, a major upgrade of the popular and long standing sample management program. The upgrade offers advanced patient data management and security along with a number of feature improvements in usability. The upgrade also integrates its two laboratory sample management programs, Basic and Unlimited, into a new single platform. Current owners will be able to upgrade their versions of either product into one of three editions. The single integrated platform offers a greater number of features for current users of both programs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To highlight the Pacific Northwest roots of the company and its proximity to two mountain ranges, the company has named the three editions Base, Ascent, and Summit.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Response to the new features in sneak previews, beta testing, and the recently concluded Freezerworks Users Education Conference has been &ldquo;incredibly positive,&rdquo; according to Freezerworks CEO and Lead Developer Cheryl Michels.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This upgrade has been a collaborative effort of the Freezerworks staff and our highly engaged customer base. Our customers have been integral to the development of Freezerworks over the past two decades, and it has been gratifying to hear their excitement over the look, feel and functionality of 2015,&rdquo; Michels said.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Freezerworks Basic users will upgrade to the Base edition, which will offer all the features of the current version, along with a number of features previously available in the Unlimited version. Unlimited users will choose to be grandfathered into either the Summit or Ascent edition.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Important new features available in the top tiered Summit edition include a configurable patient management module to link patients to sample records, and powerful security features for greater ease in shielding patient health information (PHI) from unauthorized viewers. User Defined Fields can now be tagged as a PHI field, and thus automatically hidden. To meet with evolving federal guidelines for patient data security, the audit trail records every time that sensitive patient data is viewed, by user, time and date.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The evolving nature and role of biobanking in providing personalized medicine as well as translational research makes these new patient data additions to Freezerworks vital, and this is another example why it is considered by many as the best in class and the standard in biorepository management,&rdquo; said Rick Michels, VP of Marketing and co-founder of Dataworks Development. &ldquo;Patient data has always been a vital part of Freezerworks, and stored at the sample level, while protected at the forms level. We now offer its data table, linked to the samples table, and marked as PHI at the field level as well. This will make data entry, searches, and management even easier,&rdquo; Michels added.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Other important changes and additions include more user friendly import, user defined field creation, and label printing options, and group ownership of data fields. A new RESTful web API includes a powerful and secure web based search tool and easier integration with other data sources.</p>
