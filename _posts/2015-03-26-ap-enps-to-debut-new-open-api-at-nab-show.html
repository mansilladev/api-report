<p><a href="http://www.ap.org">The Associated Press</a> will showcase a new Open API for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.enps.com/" target="_blank">AP ENPS</a>, the world&rsquo;s most popular multiplatform news production system, at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nabshow.com/" target="_blank">NAB Show</a>&nbsp;in Las Vegas, April 13-16.&nbsp;<br /><br />For almost two decades AP ENPS has led the broadcast industry with MOS-based integration to dozens of audio, automation, graphics and video systems. The Open API extends the power and reach of AP ENPS to support myriad use cases where traditional MOS-based integration may not be the best solution.&nbsp;<br /><br />For example, early adopters are already integrating traffic systems with AP ENPS rundowns and pulling data to produce FCC reports. The API could also be used to graphically show the elements and costs associated with production of one or more newscasts.&nbsp;<br /><br />The two-way Open API communication could also be used to integrate AP ENPS with content management systems, unifying all of a newsroom's news operations.&nbsp;<br /><br />The basic version of the Open API, including two-way read/write capability is available to all AP ENPS customers using version 7 at no additional cost as part of the AP ENPS license.&nbsp;<br /><br />AP ENPS will demonstrate the Open API and its capabilities during NAB in the South Lower Hall, booth SL7606, during these times:&nbsp;</p>
