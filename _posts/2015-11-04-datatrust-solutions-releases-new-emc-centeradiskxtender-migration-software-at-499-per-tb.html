<p><a href="http://www.DataTrustSolutions.com">DataTrust Solutions</a>, a leading compliant archive data migration solution provider, is the first migration specialist to break the $500 per TB level for EMC Centera&reg; migration software. Migration Software for Centera (MSC) is the proverbial Swiss army knife of Centera&reg; migrations with the broadest support for access methods and applications using the Centera API. MSC-DX was designed specifically for environments where EMC&reg; DiskXtender&reg; archived data to EMC Center. MSC-DX has a streamlined workflow that can be mastered in less than 15 minutes. Literally all that is needed is the Centera IP address, location of Centera security file and the new EMC target location. MSC-DX recreates the same file system path structure (NTFS volumes) that is presented by EMC DiskXtender. Every file is individually verified using cryptographic hashes and a complete chain-of-custody report is generated to help regulated organizations adhere to legal and compliance requirements.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"In environments where DiskXtender archived data from an NTFS volume to a pool on Centera the migration is not technically complicated and with the low MSC-DX pricing we are recognizing this fact," stated Jay Barrett, President of DataTrust Solutions. "Data Trust offers  professional services for more complicated Centera environments where organizations co-mingled all their data in a single Centera pool or used different Centera access methods, such as: API, TSM, or Rainfinity/CTA.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"With MSC-DX we are setting a price point in the Centera migration market that is unprecedented," said Rich Coons Vice President of Sales, DataTrust Solutions.  DataTrust Solutions is an EMC Technology Connect Advantage Partner. MSC software has been tested with EMC storage systems for the past three years and MSC-DX continues the tradition.  DataTrust Solutions is a channel centric organization and MSC-DX is available from our Partners.</p>
