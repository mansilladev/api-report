<p><a href="http://www.absolute.com/en" target="_blank">Absolute Software Corporation</a>, the industry standard for persistent endpoint security and management solutions for computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones, today announced that it will extend its products to use Google Maps to provide improved device geolocation tracking in its Absolute Computrace product. &nbsp;This partnership will provide Absolute customers with improved global coverage and more accurate geolocations.</p>
<p>"The location of a device is an important factor in assessing the risk of a data loss event and measuring compliance with corporate policies. The accuracy of the geolocation data we present in our products is critical to our customers," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Bill Gordon</span>, VP, Engineering and Development at Absolute Software. "Using Google Maps technology allows our customers to track devices and be alerted of risks with the highest accuracy."</p>
<p>The geolocation capabilities of Absolute Computrace include recent and historical location information for a device, as well as the ability to build geofences to contain devices within a specific geographical area. If a device goes beyond the bounds of a geofence, IT is alerted so they can investigate and determine if the device and the data on it is at risk.</p>
<p>"Our customers rely on our solutions to provide timely and accurate information regarding the health and safety of their endpoints and the data they contain," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Geoff Haydon</span>, CEO at Absolute Software. "Google Maps will ensure we are delivering the most accurate results, from every device, for all of our customers worldwide."</p>
