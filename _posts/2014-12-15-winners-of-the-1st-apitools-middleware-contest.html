<p>t&rsquo;s finally the day, today we&rsquo;re announcing the winners of our first middleware contest! Ready? Ok, almost there!</p>
<p>This has been the first time for us organizing a contest like this &ndash; and most likely it won&rsquo;t be the last! &ndash; and we&rsquo;re quite happy with the results: over 50 participants, lots of feedback received, new contributors and followers on both our&nbsp;<a title="APItools repository on Github" href="https://github.com/APItools/monitor">monitor</a>and&nbsp;<a title="APItools middleware repository on Github" href="https://github.com/apitools/middleware">middleware</a>&nbsp;repositories on Github and, above all, it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun!</p>
<p>APItools is a relatively new product but the&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html">middleware concept</a>&nbsp;is not. The possibilities are infinite and with this contest one of the things we aimed to achieve was letting people discover the many benefits and usages of APItools middleware to enhance, integrate with, and tame APIs.</p>
<p>Ok, ok. The winners. Thank you everyone who participated, but also thank you to our judges &ndash;&nbsp;<a title="Kin Lane on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Kin Lane</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Enrique Garc&iacute;a on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/otikik">Enrique Garc&iacute;a</a>,<a title="Michal Cichra on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/_mikz">Michal Cichra</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Nicolas Greni&eacute; on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">Nicolas Greni&eacute;</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Steve Willmott on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/njyx">Steve Willmott</a>&nbsp;&ndash; who had a hard time choosing the winners.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the winners!</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute winner, $1,000:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/Berelu">Luděk Berečka</a></strong>, with&nbsp;<a title="HTTP Caching Middleware" href="https://github.com/APItools/middleware/pull/45">HTTP Caching Middleware</a></li>
<li>Best middleware for a specific API, $350 Amazon Gift Card:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/potomak">Giovanni Cappellotto</a></strong>, with&nbsp;<a title="Slow request Github isse" href="https://github.com/APItools/middleware/pull/32">Slow request Github issue</a>. In appreciation for Giovanni's effort - he submitted not one but four middleware modules! - we made it a $350 Amazon Gift Card instead of $250. Thank you Giovanni!</li>
</ul>
<p>Amongst all, we've valued the popularity of the need and the quality of the code (not only the tests passing). As you can see, there are no winners in the third category, best middleware-app, and the reason why is that we didn't receive enough entries.&nbsp;<strong>To fill this category, we've decided to extend the contest until January 19th</strong>, so you can still submit your entries and win the other $250 Amazon Gift Card :-)</p>
<p>And last but not least, we also appreciate all your support tweeting, sharing and spreading the word about the contest. So here&rsquo;re the 3 winners of the&nbsp;<a title="APItools t-shirt" href="https://docs.apitools.com/images/apitools-tshirt.jpg">APItools t-shirt</a>&nbsp;for sharing their &lt;3:</p>
