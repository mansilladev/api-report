<p>When <a href="http://www.McLeodSoftware.com">McLeod Software</a> wanted to integrate text messaging into its dispatch operations management system, the company chose Bandwidth&rsquo;s messaging APIs for quick and easy development of this new feature. Bandwidth developers worked closely with the McLeod team to develop APIs that would deliver key functionality they needed.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">LoadMaster, used by over 600 trucking companies in the United States, sets the industry benchmark for ease of use and flexibility. McLeod customers are able to tailor the LoadMaster solution to their own unique business processes, while taking advantage of a robust and broad set of functional capabilities. McLeod is constantly developing new capabilities to play within the software, and adding text messaging is a major win for both McLeod and its customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using Bandwidth frees LoadMaster from the details involved in sending text messages among all the various network providers and carriers. The text-messaging feature allows for fast, easy and accurate communication with drivers to provide clear and concise information about their load assignments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Bandwidth made it simple for the McLeod development team to integrate text messaging by providing easy-to-use messaging APIs and SDKs. Since Bandwidth has both a robust API platform and also operates its own carrier network, it was able to give McLeod both the value of a carrier-direct messaging gateway, and the ease-of-use of a cloud communications API platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our customers wanted the ability to communicate via text messaging and Bandwidth&rsquo;s APIs and SDKs for text messaging made it easy for us to implement that core functionality into our software directly," said Robert Brothers, Manager of Product Development, McLeod Software. &ldquo;When we started, our developers had a basic prototype working in only a few days. All communications between drivers and dispatch continue to be captured right within the software, which now includes functionality to send text messages with a few clicks of a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a great experience to work with a industry leader like McLeod Software,&rdquo; said Jason Sommerset, Senior Director, Product Management, Bandwidth.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a growing trend to see two-way communications channels like text messaging integrated seamlessly into enterprise software &mdash; to improve both the user experience and productivity of using the software. We&rsquo;ve enjoyed working with McLeod product managers to help them quickly evaluate designs and develop the right user experience for texting embedded into their product. We look forward to working with them in the future for new ideas that improve the user experience even more.&rdquo;</p>
