<p><a href="http://www.first-american.net">First American Payment Systems</a>, a leader in the payment processing industry, has released 1stPayBlazeTM, a new product comprised of payment integration, merchant boarding and reporting tools that make it easy for ISVs (Integrated Software Vendors) to quickly accept payments on their platform and to sign up new merchants.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"As the payments world evolves, ISV partners are looking to increase revenue and differentiate their product offerings in the marketplace,&rdquo; said Neil Randel, Chief Executive Officer for First American Payment Systems. &ldquo;1stPayBlaze provides that functionality to the ISV community, as well as to their existing and new merchants, backed by our award-winning customer service and technical support. Our tools allow developers to incorporate this advanced technology within their software or website quickly and easily, eliminating many of the complex integration steps required in certifications.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">1stPayBlaze offers a REST API in multiple languages including JavaScript, Ruby, Python, WCF and PHP allowing a developer to drop in code into their platform or solution in order to accept payments securely. The API includes code for simple payments, recurring billing, ACH payments, customized reporting and more. In addition, the code is also available on GitHub.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The product also offers the ability to sign up merchants with either a branded web form that can be created and added to a partner&rsquo;s website in minutes or an API for full customization of the merchant boarding process.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Rocket Company, a company focused on coaching and providing resources to church leadership teams, recently used 1stPayBlaze to sign up new customers. &ldquo;1stPayBlaze helped expedite the online application process for our customers by making it convenient,&rdquo; said Renee Weber, Chief of Staff at The Rocket Company. &ldquo;The ability to customize this process for how we run our business makes life easier for the customers we are serving. I would highly recommend using 1stPayBlaze to get your customers or merchants up and running faster with less headaches.&rdquo;</p>
