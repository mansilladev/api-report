<p>Across market sectors, businesses are recognizing strategic advantages provided by the Internet of Things (IoT). At API Days San Francisco (API Days SF) 2015, WSO2 Vice President of Solutions Architecture Asanka Abeysinghe will discuss how to connect IoT devices and sensors with other enterprise systems using APIs.

<p>The presentation, &ldquo;APIs: The Bridge to IoT,&rdquo; will run 2:00 &ndash; 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 17, 2015. Asanka will begin by examining how APIs enable the extensibility of business operations in internal, external and partner networks. He then will discuss the relationship between APIs and IoT as well as how APIs can be used to bridge IoT with other technology domains, such as existing service-oriented architecture (SOA) and legacy systems within the enterprise. Asanka will conclude by presenting a reference architecture for IoT-based systems and describe use cases, which reference WSO2&rsquo;s enterprise middleware and cloud platform as a toolset for implementation.</p>
