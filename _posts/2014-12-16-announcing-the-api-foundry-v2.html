<h3>Announcing: Automatic API Documentation</h3>
<p>One of most important features of the <a href="http://www.socrata.com/products/api-foundry/">Socrata API Foundry</a> was the automatically generated API documentation created for every Foundry API. It included all the information a developer would need to get started with their application, including documentation about how to query and interact with the API. However, one of the drawbacks of API Foundry is that it created two worlds - an upper-echelon of Foundry APIs with their tailored documentation, and a lower tier of normal Socrata datasets with a lower end developer experience.</p>
<p>Socrata&rsquo;s new automatic API documentation feature seeks to close that gap by automatically generating Foundry-style API docs for&nbsp;<strong>every Socrata dataset</strong>, accessible from the standard API sidebar. The generated documentation is also tightly integrated with the rest of Socrata&rsquo;s developer resources and documentation.</p>
<p>Automatic API documentation was originally slated to be launched with the new Socrata user experience in Spring 2015, however based on consistent and strong feedback by the developer community, we&rsquo;ve made it available to all customers&nbsp;<strong>starting immediately</strong>.</p>
<h3>Deprecation Plans for API Foundry V1</h3>
<p>In order to provide the consistent, high-quality developer experience across the Socrata platform that civic application developers demand Socrata has planned a process to deprecate the API Foundry V1 on&nbsp;<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">February 1, 2015</span></span>. We have planned this to provide as minimal a disruption to customers as possible according to the following schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>The API Foundry V1 and the Foundry wizard will run along side with the new automatic documentation until&nbsp;<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">February 1, 2015</span></span>.</li>
<li>On&nbsp;<span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">February 1, 2015</span></span>, the API Foundry V1 and the Foundry wizard to create new Foundry APIs will be disabled, and old API Foundry documentation pages will redirect to equivalent automatic documentation templates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Socrata Developer Program</h3>
<p>Socrata is also pleased to announce the launch of our new <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/">Socrata Developer Program</a>, an effort to streamline and improve the experience for our civic developer community. As part of the Socrata Developer Program, we&rsquo;ll be providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer-focused content, support, and sample code and SDKs provided by our full-time team of developer experience experts and evangelists</li>
<li>Coaching and support for our customers in the art of running civic hackathons, app contests, and hack nights</li>
<li>The opportunity for civic applications to be featured within the Socrata App Marketplace, getting civic developers and entrepreneurs extra exposure with our customers and citizen users</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the coming months, we&rsquo;ll announce further ways in which the Socrata Developer Program will continue to bring value to our customers and users. In late January, we&rsquo;ll announce our plans to our customers via a public webinar.</p>
