<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">Restlet</a>, creators of the most widely deployed framework for APIs, today announced the general availability of APISpark, a cloud service for developers seeking to quickly publish and manage APIs, and businesses that want to give application and website developers around the world access to their data. APISpark is available for free as a cloud solution for low-traffic projects with pricing that increases with usage.</p>
<p>APISpark leverages the Restlet Framework, the world&rsquo;s most widely-used open source API framework with 2 million downloads and and a thriving community of 100,000 developers. The Restlet team is led by some of the world&rsquo;s experts on representational state transfer (REST), a popular architectural style for software that allows developers and business to share data and software components as web APIs.</p>
<p>Software developers can go to the APISpark site and use a web browser to securely create and publish REST APIs in minutes, exposing new or existing data sources. Experience with REST is not required.</p>
<p>Customers can start with APISpark immediately by creating an account at http://restlet.com/apispark and selecting either a free plan or a paid plan. The free plan provides access to an enterprise-grade platform that includes design, deployment and management features for an unlimited number of APIs. Pricing scales with the number of simultaneously connected clients to the APIs. Paid plans start at $19 per month with no long-term commitment.</p>
