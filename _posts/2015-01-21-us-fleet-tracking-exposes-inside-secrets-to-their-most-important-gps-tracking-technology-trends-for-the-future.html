<p>GPS tracker systems can be utilized for many things such as to monitor the hours a vehicle spends driving, idle time and fuel usage. By recording this data of fleet drivers, managers can monitor them much easier. As stated by the Greek Philosopher, Heraclitus, "everything changes and nothing stands still." This is very much true of the ever-changing&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="GPS tracker" href="http://www.usfleettracking.com/gps-tracking-products">GPS tracker</a>&nbsp;technology trends. According to an article published in Automotive Fleet Magazine, some of the most important technology trends for GPS trackers are prognostics for vehicle maintenance and integration.</p>
<p>Prognostics for vehicle maintenance: For years it has been possible to collect engine diagnostics data, but using GPS tracker technology to prevent vehicle breakdowns is becoming the way of the future and is setting the new standard for vehicle maintenance. The GPS tracker can help managers keep up with maintenance by having scheduled, automatic reminder prompts.</p>
<p>Integration: Having the most up-to-date&nbsp;<a class="trackingLink" title="GPS tracker" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c2ZsZWV0dHJhY2tpbmcuY29tL2dwcy10cmFja2luZy1wcm9kdWN0cw==">GPS tracker</a>&nbsp;technology can certainly improve customer service. With that being said, it is important for drivers to know that Application Programming Interface (API), map overlays, data connect and data dump integration are becoming progressively popular. These software platforms will make a business run more smoothly and it is technology that is very easy to use. The most important benefit of API integration would be the ability to add a customer map, which shows real-time locations of vehicles, on a website or mobile device for customers to see any time. This, too, will make customers happy.</p>
<p>As things change, it is important to be on the lookout for updates to keep a business working with the best technology out there.</p>
