<p><a href="https://www.canto.com/">Canto</a>, a leading provider of digital asset management (DAM) solutions, today announced the availability of Cumulus X with new features that further extend its lead in the enterprise DAM market. This milestone version 10 release introduces &lsquo;Cumulus Portals&rsquo; for branded, mobile-friendly, read-only access to assets by thousands of simultaneous users; as well as a completely new iOS app for better, read/write mobile DAM support on iPad and iPhone. Cumulus X also delivers a greatly enhanced API for integration with other enterprise applications and third-party platforms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cumulus X promises to solve the chaos of managing ever-expanding libraries of digital content including images, videos and other visual assets.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Now available, Cumulus X was built using responsive design, which enables support for all screen sizes, standard mobile devices and operating systems, including iOS and Android. The software allows for future adaptation to new platforms and even IoT-supported devices. In addition, its mobile-first architecture empowers companies to simplify access to their digital assets and collaboration with distributed teams, partners, agencies and freelancers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our longstanding commitment to creating a better, more engaging user experience for our customers, while also establishing digital asset management as an indispensable enterprise application, continues with the availability of Cumulus X,&rdquo; said Jack McGannon, CEO of Canto. &ldquo;Not only have we created more opportunities for our customers to integrate DAM with third-party platforms and enterprise applications with a more extensible API, but we also now offer organizations more options to access and manage their digital assets no matter where they are logistically.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Cumulus X API addresses a major hurdle that has hindered DAM from becoming a critical component of marketing technology stacks. In order to leverage the full benefits of enterprise DAM, companies have been required to create custom integrations between their DAM solution and enterprise systems, such as content management systems (CMS), project management, marketing automation, ERP, ecommerce and publishing applications. The Cumulus X API solves the issue of time, cost and complexity for creating these integrations, while providing an unparalleled level of interoperability.</p>
