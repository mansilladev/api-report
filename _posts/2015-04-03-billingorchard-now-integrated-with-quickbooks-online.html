<p><a href="http://www.billingorchard.com/">BillingOrchard</a> today announced a new integration with QuickBooks Online exclusively for customers. This powerful plug-in on the BillingOrchard invoicing software, will allow business owners to connect their QuickBooks Online account with the BillingOrchard platform to easily accept payments, track and report invoices at cheaper payment processing rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We noticed a recurring theme with our clients having to send financial information to their accountants and bookkeepers to be put in QuickBooks Online, and on the flip side of that, business owners who were simply using QuickBooks Online for invoicing weren&rsquo;t receiving the full benefits and features that BillingOrchard offers. We realized we could easily fix that disconnect by offering an easy way for the two platforms to communicate,&rdquo; says Rich Starkey, Head Product Manager for BillingOrchard.</p>
<p>The new feature comes at no extra cost to BillingOrchard clients, and they can easily connect to QuickBooks Online themselves in seconds within their settings. Once the plug-in is complete, the the BillingOrchard data will be mapped to three lists within QuickBooks Online: Accounts Receivable, Income and Deposits.</p>
<p>Lastly, BillingOrchard greatly enhances the functionality and ease-of-use for QuickBooks Online invoicing. A few features include:&nbsp;<br />Cheaper payment processing rates than Intuit&nbsp;<br />Automatically identifying when invoices are late &amp; sending reminders&nbsp;<br />An easy-to-use interface that replaces the complexity of QuickBooks Online invoicing&nbsp;<br />Unlimited customer support</p>
