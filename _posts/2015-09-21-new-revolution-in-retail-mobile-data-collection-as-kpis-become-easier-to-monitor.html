<p>It used to be a challenge in the retail-related businesses to monitor and analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with the old-fashioned approach of paper forms and manual data entry. Mobile data collection came to revolutionize retail audits by doing away with that and automating information gathering.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Recently, software providers began offering analytics tools bundled with their mobile data capture solutions and, now, access to retail KPIs has become virtually instant, speeding up sometimes critical decision-making.</p>
