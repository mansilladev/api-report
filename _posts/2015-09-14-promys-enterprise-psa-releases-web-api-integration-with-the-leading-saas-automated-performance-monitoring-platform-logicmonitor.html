<p><a href="http://www.promys.com">Promys</a>, a leader in enterprise professional services automation software for technology solution providers, announced that it has completed Web API integration with LogicMonitor. LogicMonitor offers powerful performance monitoring capabilities for managed and cloud service providers. Its abilities include monitoring technologies at all levels of the infrastructure stack from network gear, switching, databases, storage, virtualization and applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We had previously completed a custom integration with LogicMonitor for one of our larger Cisco Gold Partners just prior to our releasing the HTML5 version of Promys Enterprise PSA, which supports a full Web API. Once we learned that the latest version of LogicMonitor also supports a full Web API, it made sense to re-visit the integration because Web API integration provides much more configurable  integration tools , as opposed to the constraints that come along with custom integrations." said David Donnelly, VP of Development at Promys.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Promys will support alert, alert message, company, device name, IP address, serial number, batch job status, IPMI and Windows event logs, SNMP taps and Syslog messages as part of the initial LogicMonitor integration. We'll be working with our customers to take advantage of some of the more interesting capabilities that the Web API integration approach supports." continued Donnelly.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The nice thing about the Web API integration approach is that our customers can use the LogicMonitor built-in sys admin tools to create a customer specific integration data set and Promys can leverage our Web API tools to integrate that data set with no customization.&rdquo; remarked Donnelly.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">John Breakey, founder and former CEO of Unis Lumin, a Cisco Gold Partner and current CEO of Promys adds, &ldquo;The Web API integration capabilities are just one example of the leading edge technology that the new HTML5 version of Promys Enterprise PSA supports. But in addition to making it faster and easier to integrate with other 3rd party applications, the real opportunity for Promys&rsquo; customers, is that Promys Enterprise PSA will make it much easier to  share information with their customers. That will add value to those relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About Promys </strong><br />Promys is currently used by some of the largest IT Solution providers in North America, the UK and Australia. Promys was originally developed for a Cisco Gold/Master partner in 1998 to address the fundamental problem that IT solution providers face &ndash; how to tie professional services together with complex equipment solution delivery and multi-layered post-sales support.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In 2003, Promys was spun off as its own corporate entity. Promys quickly added customers in the IT solution provider, systems integrator and managed services marketplace, including one of the largest and most recognized technology solution providers in the world.
