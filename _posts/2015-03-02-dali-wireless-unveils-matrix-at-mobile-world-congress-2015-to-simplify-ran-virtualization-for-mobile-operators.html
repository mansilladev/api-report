<p><a title="Dali Wireless" href="http://daliwireless.com/">Dali Wireless, Inc.</a>, a global provider of the advanced all-digital RF Router&reg; that transcends Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS), today unveils Matrix, a modular platform which allows mobile operators and system integrators to effortlessly update, upgrade, and expand their networks in a plug-and-play approach as frequency bands and technologies evolve and become available. The inherent flexibility and scalability of Matrix obviates the need for operators to overhaul their existing networks to keep up with current and future network technology trends. This makes Matrix suitable for many environments which demands dynamic capacity allocation and virtualization of the Radio Access Network (RAN).</p>
<p>Dali Matrix&trade; is based on the award-winning RF Router, Dali&rsquo;s patented platform which enables wireless coverage and capacity to be elastically routed to where network resources are needed, when it&rsquo;s needed. The plug-and-play capabilities of Matrix allows for simple and streamlined &ldquo;mix-and-match&rdquo; support for global frequency bands, technologies, and base station vendors, empowering them with a virtualized RAN.</p>
<p>Nick Marshall, Research Director at ABI Research notes: &ldquo;RAN virtualization is one of the top five technology disruptors.&rdquo; (Source: ABI Research,&nbsp;Top Technology Disruptors). Unlike Cloud RAN (C-RAN) which only virtualizes the baseband processing resources, Matrix&rsquo;s RAN virtualization capabilities exceed C-RAN by also virtualizing an operators&rsquo; most valuable and finite asset &ndash; spectrum. This enables a common pool of resources to be shared and managed within the baseband and radio resources for a truly virtualized RAN. With Matrix, operators will be able to identify and dynamically manage data packets among 2G, 3G, 4G, and even 5G base stations transported among any antenna points, in single- or multi-operator network environments. Radio resources are only consumed when required in order to maximize all usable resources on the network, and to ensure that none is wasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dali is an early innovator and leading vendor of virtualized, digital RF routing and distribution solutions for in-building wireless systems,&rdquo; said Marshall. &ldquo;The hallmark of Dali&rsquo;s virtual RAN is the many-to-many relationship between baseband, radio and antenna.&rdquo; Marshall concludes: &ldquo;Dali&rsquo;s RF Router offers an economical alternative which surpasses conventional DAS in performance, functionality, power and total cost of ownership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matrix provides maximum design flexibility for operators by allowing them to easily scale without substantial overhaul or investments to their existing networks. Matrix works with existing centralized and distributed base station architectures and acts as a complementary solution to C-RAN. Matrix supports any combination of RF and digital baseband inputs and its baseband interface module has an open application programming interface (API) which enables simplified association of radio components among multiple base station vendors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the maturation of network technologies, much of today&rsquo;s networks primarily designed for voice are becoming saturated and stressed with unprecedented volumes of data traffic. This escalates the complexities when operators attempt to manage and scale such networks,&rdquo; said Albert Lee, CEO of Dali Wireless. &ldquo;Matrix is designed from the ground-up with flexibility and scalability in mind to help mobile operators truly future-proof their networks by addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with the rapidly evolving wireless ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
