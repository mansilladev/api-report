<p>Today we&rsquo;re happy to announce that the HTTP Git beta is over and that <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/12/5/http_git_now_generally_available">HTTP Git is fully ready for production</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/11/6/announcing_http_git_beta">beta was launched</a>&nbsp;less than a month ago and we are already handling thousands of HTTP Git builds per day. In addition, HTTP Git&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/11/13/announcing_beta_dropbox_sync">powers the Dropbox Sync</a>&nbsp;beta, making sure that Dropbox folders and Heroku repos are up-to-date. Over the past month, we have seen great adoption from partners, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-11-14-faster-heroku-deployments/">Travis CI is using HTTP Git</a>&nbsp;as the default git strategy for Heroku deployments.</p>
<p>We encountered few issues during the beta, and we&rsquo;re confident that HTTP Git is the best Git implementation for most Heroku users. For that reason, we&rsquo;re making HTTP Git the default setup when repos are configured by Heroku tooling. We will keep SSH Git as an option and SSH Git still works for all repos on Heroku. You can use SSH Git and HTTP Git (and Dropbox Sync) interchangeably as needed by you and your collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
