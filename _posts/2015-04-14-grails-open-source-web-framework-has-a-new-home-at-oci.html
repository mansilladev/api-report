<p><a href="http://www.ociweb.com/">OCI (Object Computing, Inc.)</a> today announced that Graeme Rocher, Grails Co-Founder and Project Lead, and Jeff Brown, Principal Software Engineer and Senior member of Grails Core Team, have joined OCI to lead its Grails product team.</p>
<p>With this move, Grails remains in the hands of its original architects and contributors. &ldquo;We are already actively working on supporting the newly released Grails 3.0 and plotting the roadmap for 3.1 and beyond, &rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;Now, with the support and backing of OCI, an established IT solutions engineering firm, with deep roots in Open Source, Grails is moving forward with maximum momentum,&rdquo; Brown continued.</p>
<p>Grails is a powerful web framework for the Java platform, aimed at multiplying developers&rsquo; productivity - thanks to its Convention-over-Configuration approach, sensible defaults, and opinionated APIs. It integrates smoothly with the JVM, allowing immediate productivity whilst providing powerful features, including integrated ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), Domain-Specific Languages, run-time and compile-time meta-programming and asynchronous programming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're very excited by the style and explosive growth of the Grails community. Grails has taken its place as the best way to write server-side JVM applications&rdquo;, said Rocher.</p>
<p>OCI Founder Ebrahim Moshiri added, &ldquo;Our investment in Grails reinforces OCI&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to the Open Source Community. We embrace the opportunity to support and empower the Grails team to continually enhance the product's capabilities. Our goal is to integrate Grails technology to support our clients developing high performance infrastructure solutions in Big Data and Analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT)."</p>
