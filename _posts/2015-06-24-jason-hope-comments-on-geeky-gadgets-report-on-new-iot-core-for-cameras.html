<p class="responsiveNews">The Internet of Things is coming to cameras, according to a recent article in Geeky Gadgets. The article discusses a new Internet of Things platform in development from China-based Shuwen Liu. The platform, the Vigek IOT Core, is designed specifically to take photos and add other functions that project developers will need. Jason Hope, futurist and tech expert from Arizona, believes this is another interesting Internet of Things innovation to watch.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In the June 10 article entitled "Vigek IOT Core Internet of Things Platform for Cameras," Julian Horsey of Geeky Gadgets discusses the details of the new core. Right now the project is a concept, with a Kickstarter campaign looking to move it from concept to production. According to the creator, the device was designed to bring WiFi technology adn cameras together to make project development more effective. It requires no programming and is an app-controlled board.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"What is interesting about the Vigek IOT Core is the fact that it allows developers to make connected devices and apps without the need to know programming," says Jason Hope. "While not a new concept in the Internet of Things development, per se, it is a new player. It will be interesting to see if the concept takes off."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to the developer, any extension can be made with the Vigek IOT Core, which has an open server, firmware API and available app. It is a low-cost core board that will be easy to mass produce, once the campaign takes off. It works on SDK, so no programming knowledge is needed.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The board, which is about the same size as a memory card, also has an on-board camera feature, which can be controlled via remote control. "This is an interesting feature," says Hope. "The board actually has a built-in camera, even though it is not much larger than an SD card. It may allow users to take photos remotely in small spaces, or you can add the board into a new camera design and use it to make an Internet of Things equipped camera."</p>
