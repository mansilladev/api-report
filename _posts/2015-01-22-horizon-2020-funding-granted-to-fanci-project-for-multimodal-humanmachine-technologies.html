<p><a href="http://www.ceva-dsp.com/">CEVA, Inc</a>. (NASDAQ:&nbsp;CEVA), HARMAN, KeyLemon, nViso, SoftKinetic, Tobii Technology and the University of Siena, today announced that their joint project focused on multi-modal human-machine technologies, has received funding from Horizon 2020 (H2020), the &euro;80 billion European Union Research and Innovation programme. The project is known as FANCI (Face and body Analysis Natural Computer Interaction) and CEVA will act as the project coordinator.</p>
<p>The FANCI project is centered around the integration of multi-modal human-machine technologies on a single platform, realizing significant cost and power savings for the implementation of these functions in embedded products. FANCI will research, innovate, architect, design, develop and validate innovative multi-modal face and body analytics and natural computer interfaces (NCI), develop a reference platform fitting a variety of applications, and provide validation through user experience evaluation and benchmarking. Initially the project will focus on the automotive industry to validate this technology.</p>
<p>Each of the bodies involved bring industry-leading expertise in their chosen fields: CEVA (<span class="xn-location">Israel</span>) as the provider of the CEVA-MM3101 imaging and vision platform and computer vision libraries for the human-machine technologies, HARMAN (<span class="xn-location">Germany</span>) as the automotive industry expert, KeyLemon (<span class="xn-location">Switzerland</span>) as the provider of face authentication software, nViso (<span class="xn-location">Switzerland</span>) as the provider of emotion detection software, SoftKinetic (<span class="xn-location">Belgium</span>) as the provider of 3D vision technologies and gesture software, Tobii Technology (<span class="xn-location">Sweden</span>) as the provider of eye tracking technology, and the University of Siena (<span class="xn-location">Italy</span>) as the developer of the application layer and the user API. FANCI will integrate all of these capabilities in a market-ready reference architecture, demonstrated by building a creative automotive application-suite demonstrator, including an application programming interface (API) for software application developers.</p>
<p>Commenting on the successful grant application, Shay Adar, Director of Technology Collaborative Programs at CEVA and Coordinator of FANCI, stated: "This funding from the European Union will enable us to accelerate our collaborative efforts to develop a fully-featured multi-modal platform for a highly-immersive human-machine interactive experience. Integrating all of these technologies into single reference architecture for embedded products will serve to validate the cost and power savings achievable and enable us to demonstrate the true capabilities of a fully-featured human-machine user experience."</p>
