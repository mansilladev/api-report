<p>We&rsquo;re very pleased to release Digits login for web today. It&rsquo;s a new way for you to enable phone-based login for your mobile apps&rsquo; websites.</p>
<p>For those of you building mobile-first services, the best signup experience is likely to be through the native app. But you may also want your users to continue to engage with your apps on the web. Until now, there hasn&rsquo;t been any phone-based login solution for the web, let alone a solution designed specifically with mobile developers in mind.</p>
<p>With Digits login for web, you can implement a simple and secure login on your app&rsquo;s website with just a few lines of code. To help you preserve the mobile-first experience of your service, your users still sign up first through your mobile app, as they normally would, before they can log in to your site. But now, not only can Digits help you drive more downloads for your app, it also enables you to bring your mobile service onto the web &mdash; ensuring a&nbsp;<strong>consistent identity experience</strong>&nbsp;across platforms.</p>

And we&rsquo;ve made the login flow incredibly simple so users can easily complete the process. When they log in on web for the first time, they first receive a confirmation code via SMS on their phones, which they just type into the same browser window to complete the flow.</p>

<p><strong>Single-log-in: completely streamlined</strong></p>
<p>Passwords or other extra steps in the login process may reduce your website&rsquo;s conversion rate. Digits login for web gives your users a powerful, single-log-in experience that also increases the conversion rate for your logins. Once a user has successfully authenticated via a website powered by Digits, Digits will intelligently omit SMS confirmation the next time the user logs into any other sites that are also powered by Digits. The result: users&nbsp;<strong>only have to log in on the web once</strong>&nbsp;to engage with all of your services as well as other apps in the ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Seamless installation</strong></p>
<p>Unlike other web login services, Digits login for web doesn&rsquo;t force you to deal with the complexity of OAuth. To install, simply include&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.digits.com/1/sdk.js" target="_blank">our JavaScript SDK</a>&nbsp;in your web application, and attach it to your login button of choice. Our library is cached, self-contained and minimal in memory footprint; you do not have to include any other third-party libraries. And as we release new features, our SDK will auto-update without ever breaking your site.</p>
<p>With Digits, you&rsquo;ll never have to build your own login solution or infrastructure that works for both mobile or web &ndash; we&rsquo;ve done all the heavy lifting for you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
