<p><a href="http://www.parasoft.com/">Parasoft</a> luanched a consolidated platform uniting API testing, service virtualization, and test environment management. The new product capabilities allow an organization to "shift left" the testing effort and accelerate the SDLC to meet the growing time-to-market pressure for software applications.</p>
<p>Parasoft's enterprise-grade API Testing solution for testing end-to-end transactions through complex dependent environments (e.g., message brokers, databases, mainframes, ERPs, and other endpoints) has been leading the industry since its introduction in 2002. Now, through its integration with Parasoft's award-winning service virtualization and test environment management functionality, organizations can provide access to complete test environments significantly earlier in the SDLC&mdash;dramatically increasing test automation efficiency.</p>
<p>Key new functionality introduced in the common framework includes:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Next-generation virtual asset and test creation delivers the most logical and concise set of New generated service virtualization and test assets. </li>
<li>Effortless handling of REST services and JSON payloads with advanced automation. </li>
<li>Rapid browser-based creation and management of test and service virtualization assets from Environment Manager </li>
<li>Centralized visibility into the entire ecosystem across servers and environments </li>
<li>REST API for creating, managing, and updating service virtualization and test assets</li>
</ul>
