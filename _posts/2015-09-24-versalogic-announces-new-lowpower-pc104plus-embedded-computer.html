<p><a href="http://www.VersaLogic.com">VersaLogic Corp.</a>, a US -based embedded computer company, today announced the "Fox" PC/104-format single board computer (SBC). It features extensive I/O capabilities, low power consumption, and fanless operation over the full industrial temperature range.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Fox SBC leverages DMP's Vortex86DX2 System on Chip. It offers full industrial temperature (-40&deg; to +85&deg;C) operation, and low power requirements (5.3 Watts). Based on the industry-standard PC/104-Plus&trade; form factor (4.2 x 3.8 inches), it is an excellent solution for industrial and medical applications that need a PC/104-format solution, on-board I/O, and moderate processing power.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"The Fox is a full-featured SBC for embedded environments that require low power consumption and passive cooling," said Gary Harris, Director of Technology at VersaLogic. "The Fox delivers extensive on-board I/O capabilities, mid-range performance, and low power draw on an industry-standard PC/104-sized board."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The on-board I/O includes dual Ethernet with network boot capability, up to 1 GB soldered-on DDR2 RAM, four USB ports, four serial ports, a SATA interface that supports high-capacity rotating or solid-state drives, removable flash storage, and three general purpose timers. Simultaneous video displays are available from the Fox's LVDS and analog VGA outputs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Extensive Expansion Options</strong><br />An industry-standard PC/104-Plus expansion site provides plug-in access to a wide variety of expansion modules from numerous vendors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Systems can also be expanded using the Fox's on-board Mini PCIe expansion socket which supports plug-in Wi-Fi modems, GPS receivers, MIL-STD-1553, Ethernet, Analog, and other mini cards. The Mini PCIe socket includes mSATA capability to support solid-state drive (SSD) options as well.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">An SPI/SPX expansion interface provides additional plug-in expansion for low-cost analog and digital I/O.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>For Extreme Environments</strong><br />Designed for full industrial temperature (-40&deg; to +85&deg;C) operation, the rugged Fox boards also meet MIL-STD-202G specifications for mechanical shock and vibration. Latching connectors provide additional ruggedization for use in harsh environments. Transient voltage suppression (TVS) devices on critical I/O ports provide enhanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for the system. Designed and tested to withstand extreme temperatures, high-impact, and vibration, Fox features no moving parts and soldered-on RAM. This single board computer is an ideal choice for applications that require a rugged, high reliability product.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Software Support</strong><br />The Fox is compatible with most x86 operating systems. For Windows and Linux operating systems Fox's on-board I/O functions are supported by VersaAPI. The VersaAPI Application Programming Interface (API) simplifies software access to the on-board I/O devices. Supported devices include analog input, digital I/O, and timer/counters.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Long-term Availability</strong><br />The Fox is covered by VersaLogic's 5-year product warranty and 5+ year availability guarantee. VersaLogic's Product Life Extension programs typically keep each technology generation available for 10+ years.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Product customization services are available, even in low OEM quantities. Customization options include conformal coating, revision locks, custom labeling, customized testing and screening, and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong><br />Both the commercial (0&deg; to +60&deg;C) and industrial (-40&deg; to +85&deg;C) temperature Fox products will be available in Q1-2016 from both VersaLogic Corp. and Digi-Key Corp. Pricing starts at $569 in OEM quantities.
