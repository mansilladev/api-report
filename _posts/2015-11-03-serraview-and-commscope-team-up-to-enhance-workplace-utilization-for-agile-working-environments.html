<p><a href="http://www.serraview.com/">Serraview</a>, a leader in workplace management software, and <a href="http://www.commscope.com/">CommScope</a> today announced at the CoreNet Global Summit  that they are working together to deliver smarter tools for companies to optimize their workplace and make buildings work for the people who use them.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Serraview integrates real-time occupancy data from CommScope&rsquo;s Redwood&reg; building intelligence platform to enable clients to optimize their commercial property portfolio. Data flows from Redwood&rsquo;s sensor network into Serraview&rsquo;s Smart Environments tool so real estate teams can quickly pinpoint vacant or under-utilized space and accurately track the ratio of people to desks for unassigned or agile work areas.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By adding Redwood&rsquo;s occupancy sensor data to Serraview&rsquo;s network-based activity monitoring and badge data, the companies can provide unmatched space utilization insights for clients. &ldquo;This integration will allow our clients to accurately pin-point which parts of their property portfolio are working for them, and address problem areas. For example, a recent study at one of our large financial clients found booked meeting rooms are only used 42% of the time,&rdquo; said Stephen Macnee, Serraview CEO. &ldquo;Corporate real estate departments now have access to concrete, indisputable data to support decisions to consolidate, upgrade or re-stack their footprint making their space significantly more efficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;CommScope recently launched its application developer program for the Redwood open API and Serraview is one of the first companies to work with us to launch an innovative application to benefit customers,&rdquo; said Ernest Pickens, senior vice president of Emerging Solutions at CommScope.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Serraview will demonstrate the Smart Environments solution, utilizing the Redwood data, at the CoreNet Global Summit  in Los Angeles at booth #226, October 18-20, 2015.</p>
