<p><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, today announced Ready! API Secure Pro, a new approach for API security testing that simplifies digital safety for modern web service teams. Secure Pro, part of SmartBear&rsquo;s Ready! API family, is a brand new approach to API security testing, covering common areas of risk for both modern REST and traditional SOAP Web services.<br /><br />With the broadening adoption of APIs, security over Web services is paramount. As data breaches in back-end systems become increasingly prevalent, deep security testing remains a luxury item for many software teams. API providers often do not have the combination of security analysis skills and technical context on their APIs within the same individuals. This skill deficit represents a significant risk in APIs that can only be satisfied with conscious security testing by those who know their APIs best.<br /><br />SmartBear&rsquo;s new Secure Pro empowers development and testing teams with an affordable way to quickly scan APIs for security problems as part of their existing delivery lifecycle. With this new ability to perform security testing earlier and more frequently, software teams can minimize risk of data breaches in production and be prepared for successful compliance audits as part of their normal operations.<br /><br />While APIs simplify how we connect everything, they also represent the largest increase in surface area for potential hackers since the dot com boom. Teams who build and ship APIs as part of great digital experiences need to rethink traditional approaches to security. "Simply embedding a security expert into the design organization will overwhelm the healthy tension and likely make it even more difficult to get sufficiently secure products out the door," writes Tyler Shields of Forrester Research. "Instead, both design and development teams must operate with security as a fundamental base assumption."**<br /><br />With Secure Pro, SmartBear provides development and testing teams with the power to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run threat analysis over REST and SOAP Web services to identify common security problems</li>
<li>Analyze patterns of API communication and review suggestions on corrective actions</li>
<li>Scan Web services for non-API security considerations such as sensitive file exposure</li>
<li>Run security scans over either a single request or multi-step transactions</li>
<li>Ensure that APIs work properly, are safe and achieve high performance and scalability goals</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition to new Secure Pro, this release of the Ready! API platform also includes support for distributed testing and server monitoring in LoadUI NG, as well as integration to SmartBear&rsquo;s application quality and performance monitoring service, AlertSite UXM.</span><br /><br /><span>For more information on Secure Pro, visit:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/secure/overview" target="_blank">http://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/secure/overview</a><br /><br /><span>To see more about SmartBear&rsquo;s API readiness platform, Ready!
