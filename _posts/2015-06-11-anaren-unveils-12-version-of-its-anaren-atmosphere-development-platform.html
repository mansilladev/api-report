<p><a href="https://www.anaren.com/">Anaren, Inc.&rsquo;s</a> Wireless Connectivity Group announced that it has launched version 1.2 of its recently introduced Anaren Atmosphere online development platform. Originally launched in January 2015, with a follow-on 1.1 version introduced in April, Anaren Atmosphere affords embedded developers a range of online development tools that greatly ease such tasks as code-authoring and mobile app coding for connecting embedded products to mobile devices &ndash; or the IoT &ndash; using the company&rsquo;s Broadcom-based AIR for WICED Bluetooth Smart module. With each new version, the company seeks to respond to user feedback, expand functionality, and enrich user experiences with the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only six months after Anaren Atmosphere&rsquo;s original launch and three months after our 1.1 enhancements, our latest iteration of Atmosphere continues to break new ground in making life &ndash; and access to the IoT &ndash; easier for embedded developers of all sophistication levels,&rdquo; said Mark Bowyer, Anaren&rsquo;s Director of Wireless Business Development. &ldquo;From making it easier to wirelessly connect ST Microelectronics sensors to your project through our new element library -- to a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface -- Atmosphere 1.2 raises the already high bar we&rsquo;ve set for development tools in the IoT space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anaren Atmosphere 1.2 updates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Sensors Element Library -- Users of Anaren Atmosphere are acquainted with the tool&rsquo;s ability to "drag and drop" embedded code suitable to build a project/prototype with Anaren's Bluetooth Smart Kit&rsquo;s multi-sensor development board. Now, the Atmosphere tool also includes 3rd party elements &ndash; such as an array of sensor elements from ST Microelectronics &ndash; that speed the addition of data-creating sensors and other aspects of wireless connectivity to a project.</li>
<li>New Icon Designs -- Icons in the Atmosphere toolbox have been given a facelift to help users find needed functions faster and render the user experience more intuitive and visually appealing.</li>
<li>Improved Android performance -- Android devices will now queue all of their events and carefully send them over a Bluetooth&reg; Smart connection. This will ensure messages will not be lost; fewer errors will occur while programming with an Android device; and communication between the embedded product and an Android device will happen in a more reliable fashion.</li>
<li>Code API snippet tree -- Now, the AIR for WICED API is provided in a left hand panel in the &ldquo;code view&rdquo; of the Atmosphere tool, so the user can quickly add function calls to your code. The API is also dynamically updated when an element library is added to a project, so the user can quickly refer to the new functionality.</li>
<li>Optimized GPIO Write and Read -- These functions have been optimized for smaller data throughput and, hence, lower battery consumption. A GPIO Toggle has also been added to improve the toggle functionality previously included in GPIO Write. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>New Web Link Element -- This new element allows the user to &ldquo;call&rdquo; the mobile web browser to pull up a website, a great asset for beacon applications or smart marketing.</li>
<li>Enhanced "deep sleep" mode API -- Available in the original Atmosphere, this feature has been enhanced with more customization options and added reliability &ndash; allowing users maximum flexibility in putting Anaren's AIR for WICED modules into "deep sleep" when in the field, for maximum power-saving capability.</li>
<li>ADC read fixes -- The company has calibrated the ADC reader for its development platform (MSDB) to improve reading analog values from target sensors.</li>
<li>Slider enhancement -- For developers adding a &lsquo;slider&rsquo; function to their application, Anaren has added a new, time-saving "on released" event -- so the developer doesn't have to send an event every time the slider is moved. This also reduces the overall packet size and numbers of transmissions contributing to battery life.</li>
<li>Summary: Atmosphere 1.1 Improvements (launched April, 2015):</li>
