<p>STMicroelectronics has introduced the <a href="http://www.st.com/web/en/home.html">STWBC digital controller for wireless battery charger (WBC) transmitters</a> which claims to offer the most flexible and efficient solution for controlling power transfer from a WBC transmitter (TX) to a receiver (RX) in WBC-enabled devices.</p>
<p><span>The controller is suitable for phones, wearables, and other battery-powered devices that use electromagnetic induction for re-charge.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>As a member of the Qi Wireless Power Consortium and the PMA (Power Matters Alliance), ST ensures full compatibility with these leading wireless-charging protocols and is one of the first companies that hold certification for the newest Qi 1.1.2 A11 standard.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The STWBC performs all the essential functions for transmitter control.&nbsp; The device is able to control the amount of transmitted power to match the requirements of the receiving unit in terms of maximizing the efficiency of the power transfer and minimizing any increase in operating temperature. The digital feedback between TX and RX units also allows the detection of metal objects close to the receiver (foreign object detection FOD) that could result in potential hazards, enabling the STWBC to stop power transmission when such objects are detected.</span><br /><br /><span>The STWBC comes with firmware options to offer customers the ability to personalize their end product without the need of external microcontrollers:</span><br /><br /><span>A turn-key Qi 1.1.2 A11 certified solution (reference design board STEVAL-ISB027V1), fully interoperable with Qi-enabled mobile phones</span><br /><span>API (application programming interface) access to customize the underlying firmware, for example modifying the behavior of the LEDs or GPIOs in response to the receiver behavior and supporting I&sup2;C and UART communication within a network</span><br /><br /><span>The device is offered together with a complete ecosystem to support customers in building their applications, including the Qi 1.1.2 A11-certified reference design board (STEVAL-ISB027V1), API libraries and documentation to develop software customizations, as well as a comprehensive graphical user interface to monitor real-time performance and diagnostics.</span><br /><br /><strong>Availability and Pricing<br /></strong><br /><span>Housed in a VFQFPN32 package, the STWBC is available in full production at a price of $3.00 in 1k volumes.</span></p>
