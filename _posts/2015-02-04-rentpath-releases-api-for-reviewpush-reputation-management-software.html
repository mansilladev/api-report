<p><a href="http://rentpath.com/">RentPath</a>, the parent company of Apartment Guide, Rent.com, Rentals.com and Lovely, today announced the release of a Review Application Programming Interface (API) that empowers ReviewPush customers to pull Apartment Guide&rsquo;s Certified Resident Ratings &amp; Reviews&reg; into their ReviewPush dashboards.</p>
<p>ReviewPush aggregates online reviews from various websites into a single dashboard, allowing apartment owners and operators to more efficiently manage their online reputations from a single source. The Apartment Guide Review API enables Review Push to incorporate Certified Resident Ratings &amp; Reviews on the dashboards of its clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Managing the online reputations of apartment communities continues to become more and more complex, as the number of review sites available to renters expands,&rdquo; says Scott Asher, vice president of marketing and operations for RentPath. &ldquo;Many of our clients, especially those with large apartment portfolios, need to use sites like ReviewPush to efficiently keep pace with the review site growth. We're pleased to play a role in making it easier for apartment companies to incorporate Certified Resident Ratings &amp; Reviews in their overall reputation management efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along with Certified Resident Ratings &amp; Reviews, ReviewPush monitors ratings and reviews of apartment communities posted on Apartment Ratings, ApartmentReviews, Google, Yelp, Facebook, and Yahoo. Review sites like these continue to grow in popularity and play an important role in the apartment search process, according to a recent Kingsley Associates study conducted on behalf of Apartment Guide that received responses from nearly 30,000 prospective renters.</p>
<p>The study found that nearly 70 percent of apartment shoppers use ratings and reviews on sites like these while searching for an apartment home. In addition, more than 86 percent of respondents to the survey said they'd be more likely to consider an apartment community with mostly positive reviews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regardless of where they are posted, ratings and reviews have a profound impact on an apartment community&rsquo;s ability to lease apartment homes,&rdquo; says Lee McNiel, founder and chief executive officer of ReviewPush. &ldquo;Our goal is to feed every apartment rating and review available on the Internet into the ReviewPush dashboard to empower apartment owners and operators to effectively and efficiently manage their online reputations. We applaud RentPath for making that possible with their Review API.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certified Resident Ratings &amp; Reviews is the only review site that ensures reviews posted on the site are from actual residents through a unique certification process. The process prevents phony reviews, which can unfairly tarnish the reputations of apartment communities, from being posted online.</p>
<p>There are now more than 300,000 Certified Resident Ratings &amp; Reviews on Apartment Guide listings.</p>
