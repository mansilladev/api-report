<p>Education technology partners,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosnap.com/splash/">InfoSnap, Inc.</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.software-answers.com/Pages/default.aspx">Software Answers, Inc.</a>, are excited to announce the spring 2015 launch of a powerful integration that effectuates real-time, on-demand two-way data transfer between Software Answers' student information system (SIS), ProgressBook Suite, and InfoSnap&rsquo;s online registration and enrollment management system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;InfoSnap and Software Answers have collaborated over the last six months to develop API methods that integrate InfoSnap&rsquo;s advanced Data Integration Framework with Progress Book Suite (PBS),&rdquo; said Frank Arias, Director of Integrations at InfoSnap. &ldquo;PBS users will now have a simple and powerful interface to automate the real-time exchange of data between PBS and InfoSnap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working with the InfoSnap team during the development process has been a positive, collaborative experience. They ask the right questions and leverage their expertise to arrive at approaches that are not only technically sound, but also user centered in design to offer the best service and experience for our mutual clients,&rdquo; notes Steve Reeling, Student Information Product Manager at Software Answers.</p>
<p>Using InfoSnap, PBS clients can save money, time, and resources through improved business processes and data accuracy. Families with more than one enrolled child can &lsquo;snap&rsquo; data from one student to another. SmartForm&trade; technology ensures that families are presented only questions that are relevant to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This partnership is all about providing our StudentInformation clients with integration capabilities that are seamless, secure, and offer real value in terms of day-to-day school operations,&rdquo; continued Reeling. &ldquo;For example, having access to the most current student data for new and returning students could mean the world of difference, and perhaps even mitigate risk in an emergency medical situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both companies will be participating in the&nbsp;<a href="http://oetc.ohio.gov/">Ohio Education Technology Conference&nbsp;(OETC)</a>, February 10-12, in Columbus, OH. At the conference, you may learn more about InfoSnap custom solutions and view a demonstration of the ProgressBook Suite integration either by joining our presentation on Thursday, February 12th at 8:00 am in room D244-D245 or visiting us at booth 618.</p>
