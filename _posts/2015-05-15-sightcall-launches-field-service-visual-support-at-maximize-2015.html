<p><a href="http://www.sightcall.com/api-sdk/">SightCall</a>, the most trusted partner of Fortune 500 enterprises for live video support, announces the launch of SightCall Visual Support for Field Service at ServiceMax&rsquo;s Maximize 2015 this week in San Francisco.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaWdodGNhbGwuY29tL2ZpZWxkLXNlcnZpY2Uv">SightCall Visual Support for Field Service</a>&nbsp;enables technicians to engage in live interactions with in-house subject matter experts to show a problem exactly as they see it, eliminating confusion and improving efficiency.</p>
<p>Sometimes technicians can feel helpless when dealing with machinery or technical problems they haven&rsquo;t dealt with before. If they don&rsquo;t have the right technical knowledge or expertise to complete the job, being able to talk to someone who does is invaluable.</p>
<p>Thanks to SightCall, the technician can get to the right expert with a single click in his business application. The technician can then share his environment through the back camera of a mobile device and be guided by an expert to solve his problem. Remotely, the expert can leverage advanced features such as live drawing or simultaneously reviewing the right technical documentation.</p>
<p>At Maximize 2015 SightCall will present how to reduce technician downtime by 26% and increase first time resolution rate by 36%, eliminating unnecessary truck rolls. Through our preconfigured scenarios SightCall will demonstrate how<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaWdodGNhbGwuY29tL3Zpc3VhbC1zdXBwb3J0Lw==">SightCall Visual Support</a>&nbsp;fits into existing processes and can be tailored to any use case to fully maximize resources and minimize costs.</p>
