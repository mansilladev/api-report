<p><a href="http://www.incomm.com">InComm</a>, a leading prepaid product and transaction services company, announced today that it has partnered with KUBRA, a customer interaction management solution provider, to offer cash payment options to customers of KUBRA's business clients. Through InComm's Cashtie, a powerful API that links retail cash payments via an existing point-of-sale (POS) system to a software application, customers will soon be able to pay their bills in cash at the POS of over 40,000 conveniently located retail locations with many more on the horizon.</p>
<p>"Cashtie's elegant solution will enable us to offer real-time payment notification to our biller partners and easy cash payment options to our clients' cash-preferred customers. KUBRA is committed to delivering intelligent and&nbsp;meaningful&nbsp;interactions to our clients and their customers and Cashtie's solution is well positioned to deliver an incredible consumer experience. We're&nbsp;excited that this partnership will make life easier for the consumer market," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rick Watkin</span>, President &amp; CEO, KUBRA</p>
<p>Offering a cash payment option to KUBRA's clients lets them reach the unbanked and cash-preferred customers who previously would visit a customer service station and wait in long lines in order to make a payment. Cashtie eliminates this need by making it easy for customers to pay bills with cash at the POS of stores they're already visiting, which contributes to a greater likelihood of on-time payment.</p>
<p>"When it comes to making payments, convenience is key to timeliness. KUBRA's strategic relationship with InComm will make on-time payments easier while also notifying billers when last minute payments have been made, thereby helping to improve cash flow and freeing up resources to focus on core business competencies," explained&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Thomas Cornelius</span>, SVP at InComm.</p>
<p>Cashtie powers cash payment technology at the POS, making it easy for billers, bill payment software providers, and other companies to power payments through multiple streams. By leveraging Cashtie, partners can provide companies a solution that lets consumers pay for utility bills, rent, and other payments all at the POS of their favorite retail locations. Cashtie customers can take advantage of InComm's global retail network, which has the potential to turn nearly 450,000 points of retail distribution into payment locations with no additional POS integration required.
