<p><a href="http://www.dynamsoft.com">Dynamsoft's</a> software development kit (SDK) for creating document scanning modules within browsers now includes built-in functionality for image captures from webcams. This adds to recently built-in 1D barcode reading capabilities. As a result, the Dynamic Web TWAIN version 10.2 SDK is now amongst the most comprehensive available for developing complete document management solutions.</p>
<p>The upgraded SDK's webcam image capture is ideal for developers working on web- and browser-based document management solutions. It supports the DirectShow framework and application programming interface (API). The SDK has also added Mac OS X 64-bit functionality for native scanning or the use of 64-bit TWAIN drivers. Also, the new version has an improved HTML5 image viewer and editor.</p>
<p>Other previous updates included support for JavaScript IntelliSense, a more robust HTML5 WebSocket connection and improved disk caching. JavaScript IntelliSense helps programmers complete code faster by providing auto-completion options for statements. The added JavaScript IntelliSense support lists objects, functions, properties, and parameters available to a programmer based on their current code. So, language elements can be more easily and accurately inserted. In addition to improving coding speed, it also helps reduce programmer errors. The JavaScript IntelliSense feature is supported in Visual Studio 2010+ and Eclipse 4.2+ (with Aptana Plugin v3.6+). The revised disk caching mechanism now handles batch scanning of thousands of documents.</p>
<p>"Today's document management solutions require the flexibility to conduct image capturing from many devices and this includes webcams," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Amy Gu</span>, Vice President of Dynamsoft. "The use of cameras for document management applications is mission-critical in many applications. One highly popular example is evident with online banking deposits. So, providing an all-in-one SDK with webcam image capture alongside 1D barcode reading capabilities is vital. This helps developers that are also themselves increasingly looking to develop all-in-one solutions."</p>
<p>Dynamsoft SDKs enable programmers with a simple built-in interfaces and code. With this they need only write just a couple of lines of JavaScript code to enable full scanning functions. It saves months of work and related costs and frees teams from having to also provide future technical support. The SDKs furnish users with key features for document scanning, uploading, editing, and document management within web browsers. They have built-in support for local image editing and saving options to a variety of formats. Documents can be saved to local or remote databases or other repositories. The SDKs support 32-bit / 64-bit Internet Explorer&reg; (IE), Firefox, Chrome, Safari&reg; and Opera&trade; browsers on Windows and Mac&reg; OS X.</p>
