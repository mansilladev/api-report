<p><a title="SDG Systems" href="http://sdgsystems.com/">SDG Systems</a>, a leader in system software and operating system support for Android on enterprise platforms, recently expanded its enterprise software development services with support for Samsung KNOX standard and customization SDKs. The SDKs provide application programming interfaces (APIs) to developers. The KNOX standard APIs provide the basic functionality required for enterprise applications, including improved device control, security and management. The customization APIs provide features to create a powerful user experience and to control device configuration. These APIs include the ability to deploy applications in &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; or kiosk mode.</p>
<p>The KNOX programming services may be combined with SDG&rsquo;s other software solutions, like the Enterprise Platform Extensions for Barcode Scanning (EPX-B). EPX-B provides a modular barcode scanning solution for Android that can utilize different types of barcode scanners (camera, USB, Bluetooth) with a single API. The EPX-B software is available today in the Google Play store and is highlighted in Samsung&rsquo;s SEAP solution showcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SDG Systems is pleased to be part of the Samsung SEAP and KNOX partner programs, offering our EPX software and KNOX development services,&rdquo; said Todd Blumer, President of SDG Systems. &ldquo;Samsung is a leader in enterprise functionality for Android, so it is a complementary extension to the work that we have been doing for the past few years. Being a customization partner, SDG can assist in the deployment of Samsung-based solutions, including acquiring the necessary commercial licensing.&rdquo;</p>
