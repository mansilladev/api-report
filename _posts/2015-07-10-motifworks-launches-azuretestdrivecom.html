<p class="responsiveNews">AzureTestDrive.com was built for organizations and development teams using or migrating enterprise solutions onto Microsoft Azure, and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) providing demos or offering free, SaaS-like trials of enterprise software.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Benefits for Development Teams <br />AzureTestDrive.com makes it easy for development teams to try and test server-based enterprise solutions. In just a few minutes, a developer can deploy a pre-configured image of the software and start using an enterprise solution running on an Azure environment without any IT or manual intervention. The test lab was developed by Motifworks to demonstrate the speed and flexibility possible in migrating on-premise solutions to Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Test Drives are provided free-of-charge, including the cost of the enterprise software and any Azure-related cost. Using AzureTestDrive.com, developers can create a private sandbox environment without requiring an Azure subscription in just one click. Each Test Drive is created for a fixed period of time, and includes enough free Azure resources to experience the respective solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Benefits for ISVs <br />AzureTestDrive.com provides a great way to offer SaaS-like trials of enterprise software. <br />Working with the Motifworks team, an ISV can create a fully automated, one-click and no-hassle trial of a product running on Azure.  AzureTestDrive.com can help to increase lead conversion and accelerate the buying process by providing a self-service software trial. Users do not need to download software, provision a new server or try to install an ISV&rsquo;s software within their environments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AzureTestDrive.com enables ISVs to create a full-automated installation of their products for client implementations. Sales teams can create pre-configured demo environments on their own with little or no dependency on development. ISVs can provide multiple Test Drives of a product, specific to a domain or a use case. And, using AzureTestDrive.com can be a first step in prepares software products for the Azure Marketplace.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We created AzureTestDrive.com to educate developers and provide a fast, free way to evaluate server-based enterprise solutions on Azure,&rdquo; said Nitin Agarwal, Motifworks&rsquo; CEO. &ldquo;Microsoft Azure provides several integrated services including computing, storage, analytics and database, and empowers faster development of web and mobile applications. We believe that using the Azure platform, deployment of enterprise solutions should be as easy as creating an account for a SaaS-based application. For those evaluating software, the ability to trial a live experience is much more compelling than looking at videos or static presentations with screen shots.&rdquo;</p>
