<p><a href="https://fonolo.com">Fonolo</a>, the company that improves the call center experience by replacing hold time with a call-back, and SJS Solutions, a global leader in digital displays for contact centers, today announced a partnership to make Fonolo's virtual queuing data easily visible and actionable to call center managers and agents.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Wallboards and digital displays have been shown to increase agent engagement and performance. SJS Solutions has deployed their Optymyse Digital Display Solution in many types of call centers including support desks, sales teams, operational areas, driver depots and logistic offices. Optymyse is compatible with 90% of all PBX technology including Avaya, Cisco, ShoreTel and Unify. It includes an API that allows organizations to capture data from sources like Salesforce, ZenDesk and, now, Fonolo.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Fonolo&rsquo;s cloud-based solutions allow call centers of any size to easily add call-back functionality without having to install any hardware or software. Offering call-backs provides a better customer experience, lowers abandonment rates, and reduces cost-per-call. According to Forrester Research, 75% of callers think the option of a call-back is &ldquo;highly appealing&rdquo;. When the frustration of hold-time is eliminated, both callers and agents have an improved call experience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Forward thinking companies that invest in their agent environment benefit from improved performance, lower attrition and reduced absenteeism,&rdquo; said Steve Pace, CEO of SJS. &ldquo;Our products help with this effort by mixing together key information from a variety of systems and delivering that data in an intelligent display. Because of our new partnership with Fonolo, we are the only solution on the market that adds virtual queuing data to that mix.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Eliminating hold time leads to increased customer satisfaction. But beyond that, it also drives happier and less frustrated agents, as they no longer have to deal with customer complaints about long hold-times.&rdquo; said Shai Berger, Fonolo CEO. "Both Fonolo and SJS are focused on improving agent satisfaction and efficiency, thereby creating a natural and complimentary partnership."</p>
