<p>Today, Runscope <a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/ghost-inspector-joins-runscope-on-quest-for-better-software">announced</a> that it has acquired <a href="https://www.ghostinspector.com">Ghost Inspector</a>, the automatic cloud-based UI testing tool for websites. Hundreds of companies have been using Ghost Inspector to do automated regression and integration testing for their web sites. Ghost Inspector will continue to run as a standalone service, but tightly-integrated with Runscope. The first integration is available today and allows you to run your Ghost Inspector UI tests as part of a Runscope Radar API test. One scenario this enables is <a href="http://blog.runscope.com/posts/api-tests-level-up-automated-browser-test-steps-with-ghost-inspector">end-to-end testing of APIs that use OAuth</a>. Ghost Inspector takes care of the web-based authorization flow, and Runscope Radar takes care of exercising the API with the dynamically generated access token.</p>
