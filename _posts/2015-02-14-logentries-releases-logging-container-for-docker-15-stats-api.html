<p><a href="https://logentries.com/">Logentries</a>, the leading log management and analytics service built for the cloud, today announced a new Logging Container built for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker&nbsp;1.5</a> featuring easy collection and analysis of container-level performance stats and system-level log data.&nbsp; The new Logentries Container features Docker's new stats API and addresses existing challenges with logging on Docker, enabling easy access to collecting and visualizing important server and resources usage stats.&nbsp; Additionally, Logentries has released a new&nbsp;<a href="http://revelops.com/community/packs/docker/">Community Pack for Docker</a>&nbsp;that offers users immediate access to pre-configured searches, tags, alerts, and data visualizations. The Community Pack makes Docker container log data easy to aggregate, search and visualize for deeper understanding of Docker environments.</p>
<p>"We are excited to partner with Logentries to provide our customers with a deeper level of visibility into their production apps running in Docker environments," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Nick Stinemates</span>, Head of Business Development &amp; Technical Alliances, Docker. "The Logentries logging container for Docker uses the new stats API to enable our users to easily collect key per container performance statistics around CPU, memory, network and storage I/O and to analyze them to understand important information and trends."</p>
<p>"There is a huge shift in organizations moving to containerized, distributed application architectures," said&nbsp;<span id="spanHghltac99">Cian&nbsp;O Maidin</span>, CEO,&nbsp;nearForm. "At nearForm we are helping organizations design and build micro-service architectures everyday. We were excited to work with Logentries to build this integration and provide Docker users with better visibility into their Docker environments."</p>
<p>Containerization and distributed applications are changing how Development and Operations teams design, build and monitor systems. Historically there has been little native logging support for collecting logs from containers, especially at large scale, limiting users' ability to monitor and troubleshoot their production environments. For the first time, users now have access to a multi-dimensional approach to understanding container utilization and performance by logging stats via the new Docker stats API. With access to these Docker stats, users can correlate this valuable data with other structured log data sources (e.g. JSON) to produce deeper visibility into Docker environments.</p>
<p>The Logentries Container and Community Pack for Docker provide users with:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>A specialized Docker container for log collection and monitoring</li>
<li>Centralized logging capabilities for Docker environments</li>
<li>Container-level resource usage statistics such as CPU, Memory, Network, etc.</li>
<li>Out-of-the-box saved searches, tags, alerts and data visualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>"The new Docker stats API is a big step forward in enabling customers to collect important information about their Docker containers and the apps running on them," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Trevor Parsons</span>, Co-founder and Chief Scientist,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://logentries.com/" target="_blank">Logentries.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;"With the Logentries new logging container, users can easily capture this data, correlate it with other important system metrics, providing required visibility into production Docker environments."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Logentries Docker Container was developed together with the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nearform.com/" target="_blank">nearForm</a>&nbsp;team, leaders in&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/tag/node-js/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://nscale.nearform.com/" target="_blank">Docker development.</a>&nbsp;Logentries and nearForm jointly tackled the challenge of getting deeper insight into Docker environments by enabling users to easily collect and analyze valuable container-level stats.&nbsp; The cloud-based Logentries service collects and pre-processes log events in real-time for on-demand analysis, alerting and visualization. With custom tagging and filtering, users can correlate data across their infrastructure to better understand application usage and performance, security and performance issues, and user behavior.
