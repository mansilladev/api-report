<p>Wow &ndash; it&rsquo;s been quite a week <a href="http://smartbear.com/news/news-releases/sponsorship-of-swagger/">since we announced</a> that SmartBear has taken over the stewardship of the Swagger project from Reverb. Overall reception has been overwhelmingly positive &ndash; supportive blog posts from companies like <a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/swaggers_future">Apigee</a> and <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/03/swagger-and-the-path-to-an-open-vendor-neutral-standard/">3Scale</a> together with a long list of tweets and general comments make us feel very welcome to the altar of Swagger, and Microsoft&rsquo;s announcement around the upcoming Visual Studio platform which includes deep integration of Swagger into their platform is amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do another piece on the merits of Swagger &ndash; read <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/30/quantifying-the-community-around-the-swagger-api-specification/">Kin Lane&rsquo;s latest blog-post</a> and I'm sure you'll agree that what Tony and the community have built around Swagger is phenomenal. Instead &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to focus on the two questions that we have heard most from the community and commercial companies that have invested in Swagger &ndash; and that are highly relevant and important for us to discuss; &ldquo;What are SmartBear&rsquo;s plans for Swagger &ndash; both the spec and the tooling?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What does this mention of &ldquo;open governance&rdquo; in the press-release really mean?</p>
<p>All very relevant questions &ndash; let&rsquo;s have a look at them in order.</p>
<p><strong>What are SmartBear&rsquo;s plans for Swagger?<br /></strong>Simply put: &ldquo;Business as usual&rdquo;. SmartBear has no intention whatsoever to interfere with the recipe that has made Swagger so successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>The specification and its related tooling available on GitHub will continue to be open-source under the Apache license</li>
<li>The community will continue to be standalone and &ldquo;on its own&rdquo;</li>
<li>Swagger will continue to use GitHub/Travis/Sonatype/npmjs/etc for all practical activities around the project</li>
<li>Tony Tam will continue to be part of the leadership of the Swagger project</li>
<li><a href="http://swagger.io/">swagger.io</a> will continue to be the entry point for learning about swagger &ndash; it is also one of the areas where we see major room for improvements by making it easier to get started with Swagger; tutorials, samples, background material, etc. are all things we want to add to make the adoption of Swagger easier for those new to it.</li>
</ol><ol> </ol>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t all though; the upcoming release of Swagger 2.0 compliant tooling is our most important near-future roadmap item and we are actively engaging with developers in the Swagger community to help us accelerate project development. Internally at SmartBear we&rsquo;re also proactively onboarding people to accelerate both product development and the swagger.io website; we are very excited to put muscle behind Swagger in a way that was never possible under Reverb&rsquo;s stewardship of the project!</p>
<p><strong>What about Governance of the Swagger Specification?<br /></strong>This is understandably the most pressing issue for those companies that have built a commercial offering around Swagger and its tools. The FoundationDB acquisition that was announced at the same time as SmartBear&rsquo;s stewardship of Swagger makes this understandable; suddenly a key technology surrounded by an ecosystem of open source tools was yanked away from its adopters &ndash; leaving them in a difficult situation. Their example is not strictly applicable to Swagger as Swagger is 100% open source and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/25/a-cautionary-open-source-tale-apple-buys-and-shutters-foundationdb/">FoundationDB was not</a> - but it still highlights the risk of building on another&rsquo;s technology that lacks an open governance model - be it open source or not.</p>
<p>Rest assured: SmartBear is just as eager to see Swagger grow and get continuous widespread adoption as anyone else, and we know that making the specification open and governed collaboratively is key to achieve this goal. Finding the right governance model is our top priority; our desire is to find a light-weight model that strikes a balance between governance and agility - we want to keep the community around Swagger empowered to evolve the spec and its tools just as before, while making sure that large-scale adopters are confident in their usage of the Swagger Specification. As already indicated in the press release &ndash; the discussion has started to take form internally and with key adopters of Swagger - over the coming weeks you will see that discussion moving into the public to invite the Swagger community to join the discussion and voice their recommendations and concerns.</p>

<p>We hope to have reached an appropriate decision on the governance model for the Swagger Specification in time for the upcoming GlueCon conference in May &ndash; where we will invite anyone vested in Swagger to join us on this topic (stay tuned to @SwaggerApi for details to come). We will also do a session on what is even more important to most users of Swagger; the next version of the specification and its tooling &ndash; a discussion that is already ongoing and will of course continue online for the months to follow after the upcoming release of Swagger 2.0 compliant tooling.</p>
<p><strong>Rounding Up For Now</strong><br />I&rsquo;m guessing that for some of you my answers raise more questions - fortunately that&rsquo;s what comment fields, twitter, email and google groups are for; please don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch and keep the discussion going! And if you happen to be in Boston, Denver, London or San Francisco &ndash; please come to one of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Swagger-API/">Swagger meetups</a> we&rsquo;re planning at these locations over the coming months.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time &ndash; and for your continued support for Swagger!</p>
