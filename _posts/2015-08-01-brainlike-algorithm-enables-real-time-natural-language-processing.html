<p><a href="http://www.cortical.io">Cortical.io</a>, an innovator in Natural Language Processing (NLP), announces the availability of its Retina engine in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Based on an advanced proprietary machine intelligence algorithm, the Cortical.io Retina engine encompasses a wide range of highly efficient NLP tools for text filtering, classification, clustering or searching, that work across languages and in real time. It enables direct semantic comparisons of text, making complex NLP operations stunningly simple. Now the Cortical.io Retina engine is available to developers as a REST API on the Microsoft Cloud Computing Platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our customers typically look for a flexible, highly scalable platform to integrate the Cortical.io Retina engine into their own application&rdquo;, explains Francisco Webber, co-founder of Cortical.io. &ldquo;Whether they have developed the ultimate news filter that must analyze terabytes of data in real time, or a tool that automatically categorizes product descriptions independently of the language used, they can now handle any workload, anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Because it is highly efficient, the Cortical.io Retina engine makes it possible to tame the Big Text Data challenges in terms of volume and speed. We are excited to see what kind of intelligent applications for text analytics the Azure community will come up with,&rdquo; said Nicole Herskowitz, Senior Director of Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Cortical.io Retina engine offers a fundamentally new approach to handle Big Data originating from unstructured text sources. It can be easily integrated to develop the next generation of business applications for social media monitoring, enterprise search, information discovery or profile matching, with unmatched quality.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About Cortical.io</strong><br />Cortical.io develops and commercializes Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions based on their proprietary Semantic Folding technology. Inspired by the latest findings on the way the human neocortex processes information, Semantic Folding offers a fundamentally new approach to NLP. By representing language with highly efficient semantic fingerprints, the Cortical.io Retina is the first semantic engine that painlessly handles the avalanche of text data experienced by global business today &ndash;in any language and in real time. Cortical.io is based in Vienna, Austria and on the US West Coast.  <br />For additional information, please visit <a href="http://www.cortical.io">http://www.cortical.io</a>.</p>
