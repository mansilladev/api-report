<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.simpleecm.com/">Document Capture Technologies</a>&nbsp;(DCT), a leader in mobile capture devices and innovative productivity solutions, today announced that the SimpleECM Document Management Platform now includes receipt processing as a service. SaaS (software as a service) vendors and system integrators now have a simple, flexible way to integrate receipt capture and data extraction into mobile and web applications.</p>
<p>Using SimpleECM, developers can access a hosted receipt processing and extraction service via RESTful APIs. Extracted data are returned to the application for incorporation into expense management or other workflows. SimpleECM delivers this capability via a public cloud solution, eliminating scalability and IT cost concerns for the developer. The processing and extraction is powered by new receipt data extraction technology from Parascript, building on their years of expertise in multi-format data extraction including hard-to-read machine print and handwriting.</p>
<p>Image capture of receipts is an integral part of the SimpleECM platform, powered either by the SimpleECM Mobile SDK (for iOS and Android) or by the SimpleECM Browser Driver JavaScript API, which offers cross-browser, cross-OS support for desktop based capture.</p>
<p>The receipt processing service is billed on a per-transaction basis, providing a cost effective and highly scalable solution for application developers regardless of the size of their user base.</p>
