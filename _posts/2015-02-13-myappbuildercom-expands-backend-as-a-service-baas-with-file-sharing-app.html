<p><a href="http://myappbuilder.com/">MyAppBuilder.com</a>&nbsp;vision for creating a Cloud Platform continues with a File Sharing Service. By default users can implement MyAppBuilder's File Sharing Service which includes iOS, Android, and HTML5 App. Service can be customized using Mobile App Source Code and using API (Application Service Interface) to create one's own file sharing app.</p>
<p>MyAppBuilder's File Sharing App has several unique qualities that each subscriber can modify to his/her needs. Template based app allows developers to customize the user interface. Cross platform apps allows users to use app with iOS, Android and HTML5 (Browser Based App). Developers can also download the open source app code, which enables a developer to customize the app. API allows developers to leverage the platforms service into his/her own applications. Possible uses for the application are endless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;File Sharing is a natural extension of our Backend as a Service,&rdquo; Roger Lichfield CEO of MyAppBuilder.com, said in a statement. &ldquo;Our goal is that organizations anywhere will be able to use File Sharing App to use our service to collaborate and share files based on the organizations specific needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MyAppBuilder uses Cloud-based file syncing and sharing that allow users to create special folders on each of their computers or mobile devices. The service then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder regardless of the device used to view. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration.</p>
<p>File Sharing Service includes several features right out of the box, including: iOS App, Android App, URL Shortner, Share Files Feature, File Revision Control, Archive Downloads, Browser Based, Intuitive File System separated into Files and Folders. MyAppBuilder offers the Apps on Android App Store and Apple App Store. Source Code can be downloaded from MyAppBuilder Site.</p>
