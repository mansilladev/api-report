<p><a href="http://www.kaptivating.com/">Kaptivating</a> and The Konnector&trade; technology provide hospitality organizations social intelligence that captures data, increases bookings, monitors and measures success. Recently, Kaptivating made several enhancements to this proprietary platform, expanding integration with new channels, adding group travel features and greater social media management functionality. Kaptivating's Konnector&trade; tool will provide hospitality executives with an efficient, cost-effective way to create direct relationships with customers and reduce their dependence on third-party online travel agencies (OTAs).&nbsp;<br /><br />"Kaptivating was founded to provide hospitality companies with an effective, low-cost alternative to high-cost online travel agencies," said Michael Palmer, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. "With The Konnector&trade;, Kaptivating is revolutionizing the travel industry by changing the traditional online hotel search process, allowing hospitality companies to increase profitability and retain customers. Additionally, the enhancements that we are introducing over the next few months will provide an even more robust user experience to hospitality companies and consumers."&nbsp;<br /><br />Kaptivating's Konnector&trade; platform reverses the traditional hospitality search and booking cycle by pinpointing consumers with intent to purchase and proactively driving engagement and bookings. This has resulted in industry-leading click-through rates that are in excess of 30 percent. The Konnector&trade; monitors, analyzes and engages on Twitter, as well as other social media platforms, to leverage public data in real-time for hotels and other hospitality companies. The platform's innovative predictive analytics engine identifies customers who demonstrate an intent to purchase and provides a relevant offer based on their interests. Kaptivating has developed automated matching capabilities that allow hospitality companies and their representatives to engage directly with qualified consumers in a personalized, peer-based manner to provide travel recommendations and rates not typically available to any other distribution channel. Beginning this June, Kaptivating plans to introduce increased social media integration with popular platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Konnector&trade; was expertly designed to be a simple, intuitive interface that makes it easier for hospitality companies to drive direct bookings, increase profitability, reduce acquisition costs, create brand influencers, and retain customer data and preferences for future bookings. As part of the new Konnector&trade;, Kaptivating is making it simpler for sales teams to manage social intelligence and leads from a single platform with the introduction of a new Team Inbox feature. The company is also creating a third party application programming interface (API) to give hospitality partners the opportunity to access valuable data from The Konnector&trade;.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kaptivating's disruptive distribution technology also benefits consumers, allowing hospitality companies to provide value and create personalized experiences for guests. The Konnector&trade; listens to the travel needs of consumers on a social level to match travelers and their preferences with the best available offers. It also retains customer profile data and preferences in order to offer better, more personalized service in the future to strengthen customer loyalty to the brand. Further emphasizing Kaptivating's consumer-centric approach to booking travel, the company has added Group Travel capabilities. With the new Konnector&trade;, business and leisure travelers can share their travel experiences socially, making it easier for groups to discover, plan, book, and pay for their trips with the ease of a click in a seamless manner.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company will exhibit the new Konnector&trade; platform at HITEC 2015, the world's largest hospitality technology conference, taking place June 15-18, 2015 in Austin, Texas at the Austin Convention Center.
