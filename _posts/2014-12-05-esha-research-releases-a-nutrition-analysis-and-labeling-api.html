<p>ESHA Research, producers of Genesis R&amp;D&nbsp;<a href="http://www.esha.com/products/genesis-rd/food-analysis-labeling/">Food Development and Labeling Software</a>, has released its first API (application programming interface) for developers.</p>
<p>"Many of our Genesis customers were looking for a way to integrate their data from Genesis into other platforms, such as a website, easily and quickly, so we developed the Genesis API,&rdquo; said Josh Luth, Product Manager.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.esha.com/products/genesis-api/">Genesis API</a>&nbsp;enables users to access the data, analysis, and label creation functionality of Genesis R&amp;D through external interfaces. Genesis API runs as a service in IIS and is available both as SOAP and REST interfaces.</p>
<p>The API allows companies to enter their food&rsquo;s nutrition information once and have the data automatically dispersed to webpages or internal program interfaces, such as point-of-sales systems, inventory management systems, and QC or document systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This saves a lot of time and lets developers play with the interface, making sure the outcome is suited to the operation,&rdquo; Luth said.</p>
