<p><a href="http://www.capriza.com">Capriza</a> is furthering its mission to deliver personalized, simple and beautiful mobile apps to the enterprise, unveiling today a range of user-centric enhancements for the world&rsquo;s most prevalent enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Mobile has fundamentally changed how users interact with information systems. Simple, in-context and user-centric are now the norm. However, leading enterprise vendors struggle to embrace this mind-shift, and continue to port the entirety of their complex desktop application to mobile devices,&rdquo; said Mayank Mehta, Vice president of product for Capriza. &ldquo;Instead, the key is to think about what the user is looking for at the time of need and deliver just that information. At Capriza we think user-first, not application-first, to power these mobile moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Capriza&rsquo;s user-focused enhancements will utilize the power of personalization to increase workforce productivity &mdash; enabling users to launch a simplified native mobile version of the workflow that is buried deep inside the enterprise applications. Coupled with numerous automations and speed enhancements, workflow times have shrunk from hours to minutes, or minutes to seconds &mdash; all with no disruption to the business and zero requirements for coding or APIs. By personalizing the most prevalent enterprise SaaS applications like Salesforce, SAP and Oracle, Capriza detaches the user experience from the legacy enterprise applications and makes them more powerful than ever before.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Personalization is key to a user-centric approach, but up until now, few have gotten it right,&rdquo; continued Mehta. &ldquo;Mobile is about bite-sized interactions in context of what the user needs at the moment. By taking this approach, organizations can create a new breed of business applications that bring unprecedented productivity and operational efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">New features and benefits of Capriza&rsquo;s enhanced platform include:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Extending App Reach and Adoption &ndash; Simplified and personalized workflows drive higher rates of adoption and extend the reach of the application to the hands of more users. Task-specific apps dramatically reduce the need for training, extending the reach of applications beyond power users.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Take back training time: Most employees spend at least one full day of training on Salesforce applications and more than five days training on SAP applications. These same applications on Capriza&rsquo;s enhanced platform require zero training time, boosting adoption for these business critical applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Getting Personal to Increase Productivity &ndash; Capriza&rsquo;s platform makes complex mobile enterprise applications simple, personalized and easy to use, creating a custom application dashboard for every user. While the average application workflow takes seven steps to get to the right starting point, Capriza workflows get users to the right starting point on step one. Application launch times are also cut in half so users can spend less time logging in, navigating through screens and more time getting work done.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Faster business processes make every application more powerful than the initial iterations:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Capriza reduces workflows on apps like Salesforce from nine steps to only two or three, on average.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Capriza personalizes applications like Peoplesoft and eliminates 95 percent of the irrelevant content and steps so every user can get right to the most important workflow.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Capriza tames the more than 300,000 screens and 16,000 business processes from SAP to create personalized workflows by individual, department or group.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Zero Business Disruption &ndash; Capriza&rsquo;s platform painlessly transforms complex applications into bite-sized &ldquo;Zapps&rdquo; without ever affecting the original deployment&rsquo;s functionality. Without any API, coding or application upgrade requirements, businesses don&rsquo;t have to suffer through any downtime. Moreover, subsequent updates can be made quickly and easily through Capriza&rsquo;s management.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Investment in enterprise mobility is skyrocketing: a recent study from Gartner shows that 79 percent of organizations plan to increase spending on mobile development in 2015. To make these investments have a meaningful impact, enterprises must put the user at the center of all application workflows.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Capriza is doing just that, helping companies like Del Monte, Lotus, Paramount and Sotheby's supercharge their business-critical workflows by harnessing powerful applications and making them truly mobile and modern.</p>
