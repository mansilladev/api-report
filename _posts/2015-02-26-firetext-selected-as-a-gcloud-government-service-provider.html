<p><a href="http://www.firetext.com/">FireText</a>, a leading provider of SMS marketing services in the UK, today announced its acceptance to participate in the G-Cloud government service provider marketplace. The company has fulfilled the procurement process and is now certified by the government as a cloud provider for those looking to use FireText&rsquo;s SMS services to market to their customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an important initiative within the public sector that will help reduce the cost and burden of bringing on new cloud-based services,&rdquo; said James Huff, Founder, FireText. &ldquo;Already working with a number of customers in the public sector, we are once again showing the UK marketplace that FireText is at the forefront of the SMS sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The G-Cloud Framework is an initiative aimed to ease procurement by public sector bodies in the UK government of IT services that use cloud-based platforms. FireText was accepted into G-Cloud 6 as a supplier of Software as a Service (SaaS), providing an easy-to-use, cloud-based platform to allow two-way communication through SMS messaging. G-Cloud 6 is a pre-approved list of suppliers that provide digital services, simplifying the process for buyers looking for services that fit their needs, and giving suppliers an easy way to sell their products.</p>
<p>With the Department of Health&rsquo;s central contract for SMS marketing ceasing in March 2015, individual trusts, councils, hospitals, and practices will have to source and fund their own SMS provider for sending messages to clients. FireText is now able to offer the same email to SMS service used by existing end-users of the current offering, allowing for fast transition with minimal impact.</p>
<p>The G-Cloud Framework includes a series of agreements with suppliers, which companies can use to request services, as well as the Digital Marketplace, an online store that companies can use to search for services that are covered by the G-Cloud frameworks.</p>
