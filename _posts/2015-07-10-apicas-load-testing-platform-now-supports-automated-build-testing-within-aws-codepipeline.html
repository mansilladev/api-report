<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="https://www.apicasystem.com/">Apica</a>, a leading provider of Web Performance Monitoring and Load Testing tools has integrated with AWS CodePipeline to provide automated load testing solutions within AWS CodePipeline&rsquo;s continuous delivery and release automation service. The integration of Apica with AWS CodePipeline allows developers to model the full release process for building code, deploying to pre-production environments, testing the application, performing live load tests of any size, and releasing to production - all from a single platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Apica&rsquo;s technology integration with AWS CodePipeline provides agile developers a streamlined and efficient solution for modeling, deploying and testing their applications without ever leaving the AWS CodePipeline dashboard&rdquo; says Erik Torlen, VP R&amp;D at Apica. &ldquo;This integration makes it easy to automate powerful testing functionality throughout the development lifecycle, helping Dev teams release better quality apps on time, without those common launch day surprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Apica&rsquo;s Load Test Integration with AWS CodePipeline Results in Better Quality Apps and Enhanced Internal Efficiency</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AWS CodePipeline automates the application build, test, and release process, allowing for fast and reliable application updates. Automating this process allows a developer to test each code change efficiently and effectively, while ensuring the quality of their code. Effective and thorough testing throughout development is a crucial component to releasing high quality applications. Apps must not only function properly under light or normal conditions traffic, but maintain high performance levels when under stress from heavier than normal traffic.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Apica LoadTest offers advanced scripting capabilities, a flexible SaaS platform for easy test executions, scheduling, automation and results analysis, GUI-supported scripting with no programming required, full API, and integration with APM tools including AppDynamics and New Relic. AWS Codepipeline users can schedule and run automated load tests from the AWS CodePipeline dashboard, thus streamlining the testing process.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AWS CodePipeline users can sign up for a free version of Apica&rsquo;s LoadTest platform (AWS usage fees apply) (includes unlimited automated testing for up to 50 concurrent users) HERE.</p>
