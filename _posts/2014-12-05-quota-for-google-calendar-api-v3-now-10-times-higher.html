<p>At Google we like to make 10x rather than 10% improvements. In this spirit, we are increasing the default quota for the Calendar API v3 by a factor of ten, to 1 million requests per day. That means your application can support ten times as many users without any need to apply for more quota.</p>
<p>And if you need even more free quota, you can apply for it in the&nbsp;<a href="http://console.developers.google.com/?utm_campaign=cal-10x-1214&amp;utm_source=gadbc&amp;utm_medium=blog">developer console</a>&nbsp;under APIs -&gt; Calendar API -&gt; Quota -&gt; &ldquo;Apply for higher quota.&rdquo; We have also streamlined the process of quota handling to make sure you receive your quota as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>A few tips to work efficiently with your quota:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/push?utm_campaign=cal-10x-1214&amp;utm_source=gadbc&amp;utm_medium=blog">push notifications</a>&nbsp;instead of polling.</li>
<li>If you cannot avoid polling, make sure you only poll when necessary (for example poll very seldomly at night).</li>
<li>Use&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/sync?utm_campaign=cal-10x-1214&amp;utm_source=gadbc&amp;utm_medium=blog">incremental synchronization</a>&nbsp;with sync tokens for all collections instead of repeatedly retrieving all the entries.</li>
<li>Increase&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/pagination?utm_campaign=cal-10x-1214&amp;utm_source=gadbc&amp;utm_medium=blog">page size</a>&nbsp;to retrieve more data at once by using the maxResults parameter.</li>
<li>Update events when they change, avoid re-creating all the events on every sync.</li>
<li>Use exponential backoff for error retries.</li>
</ul>
