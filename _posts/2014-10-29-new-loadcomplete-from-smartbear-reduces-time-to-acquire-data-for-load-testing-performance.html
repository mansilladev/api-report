<p><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, has announced a new version of LoadUIWeb &ndash; LoadComplete 3.0 &ndash; to help organizations reduce the time required to test and optimize application performance. Customers deploying the new version accelerate load testing cycles and significantly decrease performance testing time.</p>
<p>Load testing is often left to the last minute by many organizations since new revenue enhancing features almost always taking precedence over basic performance testing. By leaving performance testing to the end, companies erroneously believe that simple, quick and minor tweaks are all that are needed to meet application performance requirements. Teams are frequently left with a short amount of time before the deployment of an application, to identify, uncover and resolve serious performance issues. While these challenges affect all applications, they are especially poignant with mobile applications.</p>
<p>LoadComplete 3.0 helps test business-critical rich Internet and mobile applications in shortened performance testing cycles, providing advanced analysis and reporting, which allows testers to compare results of different tests side by side. Analyzing server and browser side metrics across different load tests becomes convenient as there is no need to perform manual comparison when a change is introduced to existing performance tests or there is a need to compare one version of the application against another.</p>
<p>Other enhancements to LoadComplete include support for an increase in the number of virtual users a load generation agent can support. LoadComplete 3.0 supports 1,000 virtual users per agent, an increase from a 250 virtual user limit for each agent previously. As a result, organizations spend less on hardware in order to run a particular load test.</p>
