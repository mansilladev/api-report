<p>Today, managed APIs are the cornerstone of enterprise strategies for connecting organizations, their customers and partners. At APIdays Sydney, WSO2 Director of Solutions Architecture Mifan Careem will present a session on APIs as the foundation of future telecommunications and a workshop on API implementation best practices.</p>
<p>WSO2 is a Silver Sponsor of APIdays Sydney, which will run February 10-11, 2015 at the Australian Technology Park in Everleigh NSW Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop: Architecting an Enterprise API Strategy</strong><br />The workshop, &ldquo;Architecting an Enterprise API Strategy,&rdquo; will be held 10:25 a.m. &ndash; 11:25 a.m. on Tuesday, February 10, 2015. In this workshop, Mifan will discuss how a good internal and external API management strategy and architecture are key to building ecosystem platforms that lead to successful API economies in the enterprise. He then will look at best practices in API management using the WSO2 API Manager and WSO2 integration platform products to rapidly implement a RESTful design, enforce governance policies, safely scale solutions, orchestrate complex interaction sequences, and reuse assets. The session also will examine reference architectures and architectural recommendations for building large-scale API ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Session: APIs &ndash; Foundation for the Modern Telco</strong><br />Mifan's presentation, &ldquo;APIs &ndash; Foundation for the Modern Telco,&rdquo; will run 11:35 a.m. &ndash; 12:05 p.m. on Wednesday, February 11, 2015. In this session, Mifan will look at how future telcos can accelerate their digital strategies by building an effective developer API ecosystem that encourages participatory business models leading to APIs as the currency for a digital economy.</p>
<p>Mifan will begin by discussing why telcos are rapidly moving to new collaborative business opportunities by exposing previously internal-only services and features to the wider ecosystem and thus creating an API economy. He then will review how APIs are the fundamental building blocks for this new telco revolution, whether as a singular identity model verified by the telco, a global set of telco API standards, such as GSMA OneAPI, or a set of services exposed by Internet of Things style devices.</p>
<p>Next Mifan will explore how API monetization is fast becoming the business of choice for telcos, which also leads to massive collaboration between telcos, partners, stakeholders and the long tail. Finally, he will look at how the right building blocks, federation models, global standards and ultimately APIs, enable a mobile developer to build apps that work with telcos and across telcos covering the entire globe.</p>

Among the WSO2 solutions are products from the comprehensive WSO2 Carbon enterprise middleware platform&mdash;including&nbsp;<a title="A" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3dzbzIuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2FwaS1tYW5hZ2VyLw==">WSO2 API Manager,</a>&nbsp;WSO2 Enterprise Mobility Manager, WSO2 Private PaaS, the WSO2 App Factory cloud-enabled DevOps platform, and&nbsp;<a title="C" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3dzbzIuY29tL2Nsb3VkL2FwaS1jbG91ZC8=">WSO2 API Cloud.</a></p>
<p>Significantly, all WSO2 solutions are built on the same fully componentized, OSGI-compliant code base. As a result, developers can easily deploy and customize any of these WSO2 products and the 175-plus components on which they are comprised, providing greater flexibility and agility to meet changing enterprise demands. In addition to WSO2 cloud platforms, all WSO2 Carbon enterprise middleware products also are fully multitenant and cloud-ready. This means IT professionals can write an application once and deploy it on the same middleware on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.</p>
