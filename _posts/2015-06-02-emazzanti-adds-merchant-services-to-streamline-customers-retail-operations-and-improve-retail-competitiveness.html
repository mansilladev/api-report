<p>The addition of merchant services benefits retailers by making a <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbWF6emFudGlmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS8=">complete retail POS package</a> available from a single vendor.

Combined with their already strong network, email, and wireless data security offerings eMazzanti provides end-to-end retail data security solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Chip and Pin/EMV Cards</strong><br />Because U.S. card issuers are distributing cards with new EMV technology to protect their customers and to minimize their losses from fraud. Retailers are looking to upgrade their point of sale (POS) systems to prepare for the October 15, 2015 deadline when the liability for credit card fraud shifts to the merchant if they do not have an <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbWF6emFudGkubmV0L3JldGFpbGVycy1nZWFyaW5nLXVwLWZvci1lbXYtcG9zLWRlYWRsaW5lLw==">EMV payment system</a> in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great opportunity to improve the customer experience by using the latest advancements in technology,&rdquo; stated Mazzanti. &ldquo;Those retailers that are receptive will most likely see the biggest improvement in sales or reduction of overall theft.  Either way, this should have a positive effect on the bottom line.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>eMazzanti Omni-channel Payment Acceptance</strong><br />eMazzanti merchant services allow omni-channel merchants to simultaneously accept payments via a variety of methods.

All of the transaction information for these different payment methods are searchable and reportable in one place in real time, which makes reconciling transactions easy and convenient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s omni-channel retail environment, merchants must stay competitive by offering customers multiple shopping and payment methods,&rdquo; stated Mazzanti. &ldquo;Having the right systems in place will create a seamless multi-channel customer experience with none of the headaches for the retailer.&rdquo;</p>
