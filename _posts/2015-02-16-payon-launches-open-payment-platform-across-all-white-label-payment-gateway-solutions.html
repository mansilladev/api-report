<p><a href="https://www.payon.com">PAY.ON</a>, a leading payment technology outsourcing company with an extensive global network, has released their Open Payment Platform (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.payon.com/next-generation-payment-technology" target="_blank">https://www.payon.com/next-generation-payment-technology</a>) based on open API architecture.</p>
<p>Open payment technology enables both innovation and cost savings, and is at the core of all of PAY.ON's white label global payment gateway solutions, which are tailored to meet the specific needs of payment service providers, ISOs, acquirers, ISVs, and VARs.</p>
<p>The transformation of PAY.ON's infrastructure to an open model makes the entire platform accessible through one unified API. One integration point with PAY.ON delivers tools for reporting, administration, and an open merchant dashboard, plus access to an extensive global payment network of over 300 alternative payment methods and local and international acquirers.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Wolfgang Berner</span>, PAY.ON's Senior Vice President Product, said:&nbsp;<em>"</em><em>PAY.ON</em>&nbsp;<em>has developed Open Payment Platform to give payment service providers, acquirers, and other payment companies</em>&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;<em>greater flexibility and simplicity when</em>&nbsp;<em>they choose to outsource</em>&nbsp;<em>to o</em><em>ne of o</em><em>ur</em>&nbsp;<em>white label solution</em><em>s</em><em>. The unified open API give</em><em>s</em>&nbsp;<em>our partners a powerful toolkit</em>&nbsp;<em>to grow their</em>&nbsp;<em>payments</em>&nbsp;<em>business</em><em>, and to serve online merchants</em><em>.</em><em>S</em><em>treamlined, automated processes remove bottlenecks, so that</em>&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;<em>partners can move quickly in a ra</em><em>pidly changing payments market.</em><em>"</em></p>
<p>Open Payment Platform reduces costs for PAY.ON's clients through minimization of technical complexity and automated integration processes, and accelerates growth through fast merchant onboarding. It also offers extensive support for alternative payment methods to enable the right payment mix in every market, and the ability to consolidate multiple existing platforms with safe, stepwise migration.</p>
<p>Open Payment Platform includes the following key features:</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Processin</strong><strong>g</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ready-made payment forms and mobile SDKs (including Apple Pay SDK) require minimal programing for quick checkout setup, but also offer deep customization.</p>
<p><strong>Administration</strong>&nbsp; <br />Streamlined integration and automated 'self-service' options give payment providers the ability to board more merchants, faster.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong>&nbsp;<br />Consolidated reporting across all channels and payment methods, plus in-depth modular business intelligence tools, for insightful analytics and informed decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Open Merchant Dashboard</strong>&nbsp;<br />All payment data information and external services are combined in one customer-targeted dashboard, with clients, developers, and third-party partners able to create and integrate their own widgets.</p>
<p>The shift to open platform architecture is a response to the increasingly competitive and consolidating market, in which fast innovation cycles require that payments businesses respond quickly to the needs of globally-oriented merchants.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to leverage existing open platform technology to build their own apps and features that integrate directly with the PAY.ON platform, guided by interactive online tutorials (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.oppwa.com/" target="_blank">https://docs.oppwa.com/</a>). The comprehensive documentation that supports the API is available fully white-label, and allows PAY.ON's partners and their online merchants to integrate, test and customize payment forms in real time.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Markus Rinderer</span>, CEO and Founder of PAY.ON, added:&nbsp;<em>"</em><em>The payments market is</em>&nbsp;<em>consolidating, and with increased competition, the need to innovate and to save costs at the same time is becoming</em>&nbsp;<em>an absolute necessity.</em>&nbsp;<em>Open Payment Platform</em>&nbsp;<em>deliver</em><em>s to</em>&nbsp;<em>our partners the technology they need to stay ahead of the curve.</em><em>"</em></p>
