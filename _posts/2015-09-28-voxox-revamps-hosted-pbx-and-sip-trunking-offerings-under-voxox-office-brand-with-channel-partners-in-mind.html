<p><a href="http://www.voxox.com">Voxox</a>, the most comprehensive cloud-based rich communication service for consumers and businesses, today announced at the Cloud Partners Conference &amp; Expo, being held at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston Mass., September 16-18, 2015, that the company has revamped its Hosted PBX and SIP Trunking solutions under the Voxox Office brand. Voxox Office is leveraging a combination of Voxox technology and third party tools to offer a wide array of new features and capabilities, many of which were implemented to address the needs of the Voxox channel community.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For a limited time, Voxox is offering its largest channel partner promotion to date in conjunction with the Voxox Office launch. Through the end of  2015, channel partners will be able to double their standard commission rate with Voxox to 40-50 percent commissions for the first year of a 12 month (or longer) contract on any Hosted PBX or SIP Trunking deal.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"The channel is our primary sales force so we are always thinking of ways to cater to partner needs," said Bryan Hertz, CEO of Voxox. "We saw an opportunity to enhance our hosted PBX and SIP trunking solutions tailoring the latest offering to our channel partners' requests, and we feel that the new Voxox Office suite offers an even better partner and customer experience. We are excited to roll out this offering."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As the company's core SMB offering, the Voxox Office solution suite provides channel partners and SMB end-users of Hosted PBX and SIP Trunking services with many new flexible features. A high-quality, reliable business phone system in the cloud, Voxox Office utilizes modern features with enterprise capabilities and costs less up front and over time versus traditional premise-based systems. New features include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> User interface for channel partners to send proposals and manage orders directly</li>
<li> Call center functionality including agent log-ins, call queuing, chat, and advanced management and monitoring tools</li>
<li> Ability for channel partners to serve customers who want to integrate their service with CRM systems, such as Salesforce, and features now available through API (such as screen pops)</li>
<li> Operator console that enables features and capabilities, such as virtually switching live calls</li>
<li> Enhanced across-the-board reporting that delves into deeper detail than prior reporting offerings</li>
<li> Unified cloud extensions (mobile voip)</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">With its CLEC operations and proprietary service delivery platform, Voxox is able to bypass expensive licensing fees that competitors pay, allowing the company to offer its customers some of the most competitive rates in the industry. Other unique benefits about the Voxox back-end technology include the ability to build powerful, scalable applications and services quickly and easily.</p>
