<p><a href="http://www.adlinktech.com">ADLINK Technology</a>, a leading global provider of cloud-based services, intelligent gateways and embedded building blocks for edge devices that enable the Internet of Things (IoT), today announced the release of the ETOS-1000 extreme outdoor server. ADLINK&rsquo;s new ETOS-1000 is the first high-performance mobile edge computing (MEC) platform specifically designed for extreme environments and outdoor telecom/networking applications.</p>
<p>Based on the dual Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; E5-2400 v2 family of processors, the ETOS-1000 MEC platform enables Telecom Equipment Manufacturers (TEMs) and application providers to deliver data center performance at the edge of the network. The ETOS-1000 provides IT and cloud-computing capabilities within the Radio Access Network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile subscribers. This offers a service environment characterized by proximity, ultra-low latency, and high-bandwidth that allows content, services, and applications to be accelerated, maintaining a customer&rsquo;s high-level Quality of Experience (QoE).</p>
<p>The ETOS-1000 mobile-edge computing platform provides computing resources, storage capacity, connectivity and access to user traffic and real-time radio and network information. This allows operators to offer context-related services that can differentiate and monetize the user experience. In addition, since the data is processed at the edge in the RAN environment, the ETOS-1000 reduces backhaul costs and improves the infrastructure&rsquo;s efficiency with more intelligent and optimized networks. And with the onset of network functions virtualization (NFV) infrastructure, having data center performance at the edge of networks can enable specific virtualized network functions (VNFs) closer to the consumer, improving QoE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ETOS-1000 was specifically designed for outdoor and extreme conditions while delivering data center performance at the edge,&rdquo; said Yong Luo, head of ADLINK's Embedded Computing Product Segment. &ldquo;This enables operators to rapidly deliver new high value services while reducing costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attributes such as shock and vibration resistance, -40ËC to +55ËC operating temperature range, and IP65 water and dust ingress rating make the ETOS-1000 an ideal solution for outdoor and extreme environments. The ETOS-1000 can also utilize ADLINK&rsquo;s application ready intelligent platform (ARiP) software, which includes PacketManager, remote management functions, and system management APIs for application developers. ARiPs enable customers to focus primarily on their application instead of the IoT platform building blocks required for cloud computing. The ETOS-1000 reduces maintenance costs by eliminating fans and filters and offering worry-free, weather-resistant, high-speed connections for copper or fiber options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the telecommunications market moves to Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), solutions based on Intel&reg; architecture, such as the ETOS-1000, can bring Moore&rsquo;s Law economics to the telco infrastructure and help service providers meet the growing demand for network capacity growth and enhanced services in a cost effective way. By using the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; E5-2400 v2 processor, ADLINK is able to offer a mobile-edge computing platform that delivers smoother, faster application delivery, improved user experience, and reductions in operator TCO,&rdquo; said Steve Price, General Manager of Intel&rsquo;s Communications Infrastructure Division.</p>
<p>ADLINK will be showcasing the ETOS-1000 at BTE (<a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaWd0ZWxlY29tZXZlbnQuY29t">http://www.bigtelecomevent.com</a>) in Chicago on June 9 &amp; 10.
