<p><a href="http://www.autosaver.com/">AutoSaver.com</a>, the auto industry leader in visual price reassurance is offering a trimmed down version of its exclusive price reassurance reports to auto dealers for free. AutoSaver&rsquo;s consumer-facing reports will now be available on thousands of dealer websites, including new car franchises, through a cooperative arrangement with top automotive website providers and dealer management systems. This announcement comes only a day after the company launched its new Diamond Dealer Program, which allows free subscribers to upgrade to a premium account subscription for a modest monthly fee. Diamond Dealers have open access to the entire AutoSaver product catalog, advanced lead triggers, trade-in tools and market supply and demand data for their region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third party lead sites have fallen out of favor with many dealers. Instead of spending millions on television ads and pay-per-click to build our brand, we help dealers enhance their own brand and improve credibility with their customers,&rdquo; states Derek White, AutoSaver&rsquo;s CEO. &ldquo;Getting a fair price is the new mantra, so why push customers to another source for pricing information? We make it easier to get that validation right from the dealer&rsquo;s website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AutoSaver imports and validates nearly every vehicle in the pre-owned ecosystem from hundreds of sources every day. The company&rsquo;s unique Savings Meter&reg; - in the shape of a diamond - formats a snapshot of the entire market on an easy-to-interpret graphic. In one glance, car shoppers can quickly validate vehicle prices as they research possible purchase options. The Savings Meter&reg; identifies what AutoSaver terms as the &ldquo;savings range&rdquo;. This range affords dealers more flexibility in negotiations and provides buyers a better representation of value.</p>
<p>&rdquo;There are products out there that mirror what&rsquo;s already shown on the dealer&rsquo;s VDPs. Our reports offer car shoppers something they can&rsquo;t get directly from the dealer without questioning the validity of the information. With AutoSaver, Dealer prices no longer need to be the lowest in the region to be attractive - only within the range,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;AutoSaver&rsquo;s reports pretty much draw a line in the sand with price shoppers but provide the peace of mind our customers look for. This significantly lowers the stress involved during the typical negotiation process,&rdquo; states Ralph Valent of MTMTCars.com.</p>
<p>Another AutoSaver dealer, Clock Tower Auto Mall uses AutoSaver&rsquo;s reports on the front end of every sale. &ldquo;Our entire sales process begins and ends with AutoSaver&rsquo;s program,&rdquo; states Clint Jones, President of Clock Tower. &ldquo;We use MarketVUE to price our cars competitively, then show the AutoSaver validation on our sites, and even use their handy TradeVUE tool to appraise new trades.&rdquo; AutoSaver has several preferred vendors that offer seamless integration of their APIs and reports on dealer websites. These are AutoCorner, Dealer.com and VinSolutions with many more coming online every week.</p>
