<p class="responsiveNews">Property Solutions, the multifamily industry&rsquo;s most comprehensive Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, announced today that it has changed its name to <a href="http://www.entrata.com">Entrata</a>.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The company&rsquo;s property management software -- Entrata Accounting, Leasing &amp; Rents, Purchasing and Facilities -- are now widely available following a beta program with more than 3,500 properties. The products have been optimized for ease of use and are offered for free, without licensing or integration fees.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Entrata, meaning open and portal, was the name originally selected for the heart of the platform - the company&rsquo;s property management software. After three years, the name is being applied to the company as a whole as a reflection of its business philosophy and its solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Entrata represents a decade-long development effort, and fulfills the original vision of the company - to offer a unified and modern platform of technology services to the multifamily industry, all behind a single login,&rdquo; said Dave Bateman, chief executive officer, Entrata. &ldquo;Entrata has improved financial performance and operational efficiency across the board for early adopters. We're now ready to announce general availability.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Entrata PaaS platform offers the multifamily property manager more than 20 technology solutions behind a single login that can be accessed from any browser or device. It is built on a modern, multi-tenant architecture that was developed with the user in mind. Unlike other property management systems, Entrata offers an open API, allowing any vendor to be integrated into the system and giving users the freedom to configure the platform to best fit their needs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We have been listening to our clients, championing new ideas and aligning ourselves with industry partners who inspire innovation,&rdquo; said Bateman. &ldquo;People are taking notice. Ten percent of the three million apartment units using parts of the Entrata platform have moved to our full property management solution in the last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The company&rsquo;s success is also evidenced by its recent announcement that it has reached $100 million in recurring annual revenue, making it the fastest growing company in real estate.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;As business continues to increase, we need a property management software like Entrata that not only keeps up with our growth, but grows with us,&rdquo; said Gunti Weissenberger, president, Westover Companies. &ldquo;Entrata is not the old way of doing things. It&rsquo;s cost effective and is changing the industry.&rdquo;</p>
