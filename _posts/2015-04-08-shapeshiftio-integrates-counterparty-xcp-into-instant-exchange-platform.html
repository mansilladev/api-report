<p><a href="https://shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift.io</a>&nbsp;has integrated&nbsp;<a href="http://counterparty.io/">Counterparty&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;currency XCP, into its instant altcoin exchange platform. Customers anywhere in the world can now buy or sell XCP instantly with Bitcoin or over two dozen other leading cryptocurrencies with ShapeShift.io.</p>
<p>There is no signup process nor account required.</p>
<p>As the digital currency ecosystem continues to rapidly grow, integration between platforms is accelerating. ShapeShift.io, which launched in August 2014, has risen quickly as the most convenient way to buy or sell the leading digital assets. The site has integrated two dozen currencies to date, enabling instant conversion between all of them directly.</p>
<p>Counterparty is a free and open platform for peer-to-peer finance built on the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to engage in derivatives, games, unlocks advanced assets functionality and extends Bitcoin&rsquo;s functionality from a payment network into a full-fledged financial platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As perhaps the most famous Crypto 2.0 platform, Counterparty has demonstrated a track record of innovation and professionalism," explained ShapeShift CEO and Founder Erik Voorhees, &ldquo;The Counterparty asset is a natural fit for ShapeShift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Critically, ShapeShift's model has set a new standard for security and consumer protection, by offering conversion services without the need for user accounts or deposits. After the cryptocurrency exchange MintPal collapsed in October 2014, losing user funds, traders have increasingly realized the risk of leaving money on deposit with any 3rd party. ShapeShift's innovation is to operate more like a vending machine, in which a customer instantly deposits one coin and receives another one, with no significant period of trust or custodianship required.</p>
<p>Interested websites can now also utilize the ShapeShift API to instantly accept payment in XCP, the native currency of Counterparty, whereupon it will be instantly converted to Bitcoin, or any other digital asset in which they prefer to hold value.</p>
