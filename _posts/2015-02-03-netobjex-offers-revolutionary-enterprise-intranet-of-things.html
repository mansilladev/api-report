<p><a href="https://netobjex.com/">NetObjex</a>, the leader in Internet of Things (IoT) technology, has announced that it has developed a cutting edge Enterprise Intranet of Things platform. The NetObjex Enterprise Intranet of Things offering will be provided through the company&rsquo;s IoT PaaS, which includes a suite of multi-pronged components including CMS, Servers, Device Registry, Custom Mobile App and NetObjex Analytics.</p>
<p>This first-of-its-kind Enterprise Intranet of Things solution allows businesses to create and manage an Intranet of Things (beacons and sensors) via an intuitive IoT CMS. The NetObjex Enterprise Intranet of Things offering is a comprehensive hardware and software solution providing companies with the tools needed to build an internal network of IoT devices. Since security is a primary concern of any enterprise, NetObjex provides both on-premise and cloud-based deployments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NetObjex Enterprise Intranet of Things solution is a first in the industry,&rdquo; said Sarah Le, Director of Marketing for NetObjex. &ldquo;This solution is targeted at corporations that wish to develop IoT solutions for use within the enterprise.

This provides enterprises with seamless integration and the ability to provide IoT capabilities to legacy applications.</p>
<p>Some uses of IoT in internal corporate solutions include Equipment tracking, Manufacturing and Warehouse automation, Information dissemination and more. The NetObjex IoT platform incorporates NetObjex Analytics to help businesses better understand data collected from their Intranet of Things deployment.</p>
<p>The NetObjex IoT PaaS for Enterprise Intranet of Things implementations breaks the barrier to entry in which expensive proprietary services have been the only option available to any entity interested in implementing beacon technology.</p>
