<p><a href="http://www.sealevel.com">Sealevel Systems, Inc.</a> has released the eI/O&trade; family of Ethernet digital I/O solutions for embedded OEM applications. Perfect for commercial and industrial computing applications requiring an embedded Ethernet I/O solution, eI/O OEM modules provide system designers with a compact, low-cost monitor and control alternative for a variety of applications including process control, facility management, security, and broadcast automation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Available in six I/O configurations, eI/O OEM modules include Reed, Form C or solid-state relays; optically isolated or dry-contact inputs; as well as A/D functionality. I/O connections are simplified via removable 3.5mm terminal blocks that are compatible with 16-30 AWG field wiring. Optional spring-clamp terminal blocks are available as accessories.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">eI/O OEM modules are available as Class 0 (IEEE 802.3af-2003) Power over Ethernet devices that allows power and data to be transferred over a single CAT5 cable, thus eliminating the need for an external power supply. Alternately, choose modules powered by your 9-30VDC source. Input power on DC modules is via a removable spring-clamp terminal block, requiring no tools and simplifying field installation. A variety of optional Sealevel power supplies are available.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Communicate with eI/O modules using industry standard Modbus TCP protocol or Sealevel SeaMAX software.
