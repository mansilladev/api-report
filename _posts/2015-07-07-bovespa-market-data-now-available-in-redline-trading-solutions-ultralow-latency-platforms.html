<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our support for the Brazilian exchange is one more example of our global expansion of market data coverage,&rdquo; said Mark Skalabrin, CEO of Redline Trading Solutions. &ldquo;Customers managing their own exchange connectivity can now connect directly to Bovespa, while customers wanting a fully managed market data solution can now subscribe to Bovespa data as part of our multi-asset class consolidated RedlineFeed,&rdquo; Skalabrin added.</p>
