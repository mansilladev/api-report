<p><a href="http://www.cqg.com">CQG</a> announced today the launch of a global equities partnership with Ditto Trade, a next generation robo-investing stock brokerage firm. The two companies have seamlessly integrated US equities trading capabilities on the same platforms that CQG global customers currently use to trade futures and FX. This technology integration also extends to all customers who access futures and FX markets through CQG APIs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Continuum Connect, the flagship data and trading API of CQG&rsquo;s Continuum enterprise division, powers the Ditto Trade application. Traders will be able to use any Continuum APIs to send equity orders into CQG&rsquo;s infrastructure for equity trading. Clients can take advantage of superb pre-trade risk capabilities and connections to more than one hundred FCM partner environments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Providing CQG&rsquo;s futures and FX customers seamless access to the equites markets builds on CQG&rsquo;s history of offering innovative solutions in the financial industry,&rdquo; said Jon Rosenberg, CEO of Ditto Trade. &ldquo;By utilizing Ditto Trade&rsquo;s technology and mobile platforms, users of CQG&rsquo;s platforms have more alternatives with increased flexibility and control.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to quality execution, Ditto Trade&rsquo;s proprietary technology enables investors to take part in the actual trades of a trusted trader (lead trader). Investors can decide whether to participate fully in the lead trader&rsquo;s trades or to receive actionable mobile alerts for review. The Ditto platform also offers the ability to instantly sync to another trader&rsquo;s portfolio on a percent-by-percent basis.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With a Ditto Trade account, CQG customers identify themselves as potential lead traders, allowing other investors to follow their trades or alerts from within the CQG platform. This provides a new way of trade monetization.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are delighted to be working with Ditto Trade to expand our range of trading capabilities across asset classes for our customers,&rdquo; said Mike Glista, CQG&rsquo;s Director of Trade Routing. &ldquo;We are constantly striving to lead the industry with cutting-edge software and world-class customer support in everything we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to providing quality execution and best-in-class customer service, Ditto Trade is offering thirty days of commission-free trading for all CQG customers who open a new stock brokerage account.</p>
