<p>Asia-based managed data connectivity solutions provider&nbsp;<a href="http://cw.com.hk/tag/pacnet" target="_blank">Pacnet</a>&nbsp;today announced to extend its Pacnet Enabled Network (PEN) into the optical layer. This allows Pacnet to provide on-demand network services up to 100G, including Network Function Virtualization (NFV) tools on the company's privately owned trans-Pacific and intra-Asia submarine network systems.</p>
<p>Launched in 16 months ago, PEN is a Software-defined Networking (SDN) platform supporting on-demand bandwidth delivery via its customer portal or simple public application programming interface (API).</p>
<p>With the new capability, Pacnet extends network virtualization to the subsea transport network, enabling high-speed capacity provisioning and automated fault restoration across its network systems. Together with its virtual appliances, PEN gives customers the power to orchestrate applications across multiple countries simultaneously, delivering cost-efficient virtualized network resources that customers can order and consume on demand.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Automated connectivity for CSPs</strong></p>
<p>Pacnet's enhanced PEN platform also delivers automated connectivity to external private and public cloud providers. Customers can create their hybrid cloud deployment via an intuitive drag-and-drop function on the platform with greater control and flexibility when provisioning between their data center or network.</p>
<p>PEN provides customers with a platform to automate flows, enable Direct Internet Access (DIA) and virtual appliances and to choose their preferred billing methods. PEN provides users with added flexibility and granularity, which is based on customer-determined network topology including design, bandwidth allocation, DIA endpoints and latency, while providing a complete range of performance characteristic options.</p>
<p>In addition, customers can benefit from enhanced endpoint parameters, which offer greater control when managing the PEN inventory by enabling the restriction of end-user bandwidth allocation and usage of endpoints. PEN user access is synchronized under individual customer IDs, providing additional administrative management capabilities of end-users within a specific group.</p>
