<p><a href="http://kodiakptt.com/">Kodiak</a>, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk (PTT) solutions, announces today at IWCE software release 7.10 for its Broadband PTT solution. Feature-rich, release 7.10 delivers prioritized scanning and broadcast capabilities comparable to land mobile radio (LMR), a Web based Application Programming Interface (API) that extends PTT functionality to 3rd party applications, and FIPS 140-2 Level 1 compliance.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of release 7.10 is a Web-API that makes it possible for 3rd party developers/integrators to add fast, easy push-to-talk voice communication to their applications. The Web-API allows Kodiak to extend Broadband PTT functionality into existing workforce management and productivity applications, increasing productivity by providing real-time voice communication, presence, and alert capabilities within existing workflows.</p>
<p>The addition of talkgroup scanning with priority and broadcast calling to release 7.10 provides Broadband PTT users with a communications experience as easy and efficient as traditional land mobile radio (LMR) devices. Talkgroup scanning with priority allows users to create and scan a list of up to 16 talkgroups, and broadcast calling enables one-way communication to up to 500 users at one time.</p>
<p>Release 7.10 will also include FIPS 140-2 Level 1 validation, confirming that the cryptographic module utilized by the Kodiak Broadband PTT solution meets the standards for use by U.S. government and other regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. FIPS140-2 compliance provides Broadband PTT user with peace of mind, making certain that their communications are secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release 7.10 continues the Kodiak legacy of innovation, delivering new features that significantly enhance broadband push-to-talk communications,&rdquo; said Bruce Lawler, Chief Product Officer of Kodiak. &ldquo;In particular, our Web-API makes it possible for your preferred application providers to seamlessly integrate our broadband PTT functions into your existing workflows, providing a new level of efficiency and productivity for your workforce.&rdquo;</p>
