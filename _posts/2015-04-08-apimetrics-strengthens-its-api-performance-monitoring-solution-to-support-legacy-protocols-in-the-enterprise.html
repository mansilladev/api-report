<p><a href="http://www.apimetrics.io/">APImetrics</a>&nbsp;announced today that its intelligent, analytics-backed API performance monitoring solution now allows enterprise IT managers and developers to test the health of their applications and network API interfaces, even if they were built using the legacy SOAP protocol. For the first time in the industry, the enterprise can test and monitor APIs utilizing SOAP as easily as they currently test REST APIs. As a result, enterprise IT managers and developers can get a comprehensive look at their APIs and discover and mitigate any connectivity and performance issues before their users and customers discover problems.</p>
<p>"Enterprise legacy systems are not going away just because today's developers choose to use the more lightweight REST/JSON protocol," said David O'Neill, CEO and co-founder of APImetrics. "With the new enhancements to our API performance monitoring solution, enterprises can now measure and track their performance end-to-end instead of looking at disjointed pieces of the puzzle. Creating a system that handles all protocols seamlessly has been challenging, but this capability is vital to our enterprise customers."</p>
<p>Although REST APIs have become popular among developers for use in consumer-facing websites and mobile apps, many enterprises continue to use legacy SOAP-based APIs for their back-end systems because they work well in distributed environments and provide valuable error-handling information. Many enterprises use an API gateway that allows developers to integrate with back-end services. Support for SOAP-based API monitoring is vital because it allows enterprises to verify the status of that gateway and proactively monitor services for quality of experience, giving IT managers actionable data to validate service level agreements.</p>
<p>For example, an APImetrics client was using an API gateway that produced a positive transaction ID from a REST/JSON call. The client knew that the ID was not always appearing in its back-end system, but without visibility into APIs using the SOAP protocol, the client couldn't fix the problem. Thanks to the addition of SOAP support and the ability to test inside the corporate firewall to the APImetrics performance monitoring solution, the client can now run queries against its API gateway, see any latency issues, and ensure that the transaction ID shows up in its back-end system.</p>
<p>Global dependence on a range of internet-enabled services built around APIs has driven explosive growth in the number of public and private APIs used today. Problems in API performance often lead to errors, unresponsive applications, latency and heightened user frustration. APImetrics offers a dynamically scalable solution with an intelligent cloud- or premise-based interface for comprehensive API monitoring, performance analysis and troubleshooting. The company's customers include AT&amp;T, Microsoft, TIBCO, Radius and Axway.</p>
