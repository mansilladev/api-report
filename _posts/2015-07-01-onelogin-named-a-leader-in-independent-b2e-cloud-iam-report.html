<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="https://www.onelogin.com">OneLogin</a> announced today that it has been cited as a Leader in the Forrester Research report, The Forrester Wave&trade;: B2E Cloud IAM, Q2 2015.  The report, authored by analysts Andras Cser and Merritt Maxim, evaluated nine identity and access management (IAM) vendors based on their current offering, strategy, and market presence, and scored OneLogin&rsquo;s cloud IAM solution as a Leader.

<p class="responsiveNews">In the Forrester Wave, Cser and Maxim write, &ldquo;OneLogin is a thought leader in authentication with plans to extend mobility support.  The solution is much less complex than other solutions evaluated in this Forrester Wave.  It has outstanding support for user directory configuration and integration, access management policy administration, and end user self-service from the portal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"We&rsquo;re excited to see Cloud IAM emerge as its own domain within the broader IAM marketspace, and congratulate the other vendors for their contribution in helping shape the industry,&rdquo; said Thomas Pedersen, CEO at OneLogin.  &ldquo;The Forrester Wave process was one of the most comprehensive reviews we&rsquo;ve experienced, and throughout their evaluation process Forrester retained an air of objectivity that we feel reflects the true state of the market, and provides a credible evaluation tool for their clients to leverage.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We believe that being cited as a Leader by Forrester is a great milestone for OneLogin.  We&rsquo;ve been a cloud IAM provider for the last 5 years and have seen the market evolve beyond single sign-on (SSO) and embrace its role in the broader infrastructure, operations, and security domains,&rdquo; said David Meyer, VP Product Management at OneLogin.  &ldquo;We feel that Forrester&rsquo;s report validates OneLogin&rsquo;s vision and leadership, and our offering&rsquo;s ability to move customers&rsquo; cloud initiatives forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To further support developers committed to integrating identity and security into their offerings,  OneLogin recently launched a new developer portal (<a title="https://developers.onelogin.com/" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXJzLm9uZWxvZ2luLmNvbS8=">https://developers.onelogin.com/</a> ) providing a vast array of tools and resources that enable customers, partners and vendors to extend their OneLogin services through APIs and standards-based toolkits.</p>
