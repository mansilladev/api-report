<p>3scale and Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world&rsquo;s leading provider of open source solutions, today announced a collaboration to help organizations take advantage of new digital channels to reach customers and succeed in the&nbsp;<a title="API economy" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.3scale.net/api-economy/">API economy</a>.</p>
<p>The joint solution combines the&nbsp;<a title="3scale API Management Platform" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.3scale.net/api-management/">3scale API Management Platform</a>&nbsp;and technologies from the&nbsp;<a title="Red Hat JBoss Middleware" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware">Red Hat JBoss Middleware</a>&nbsp;portfolio to provide an application programming interface (API) development, deployment, and management offering designed to accelerate time-to-market for API initiatives and enable enterprises to innovate faster, in a smarter way. API use has increased rapidly in recent years, and to effectively compete in the fast-growing API economy, businesses need to implement the strategy and platform that's right to support innovation and growth for their business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the past two years, a critical mass of companies and government institutions has been publishing APIs into their data and some functions of their IT systems to fuel business-to-consumer (B2C) innovation, enable mobile apps and take advantage of more-direct B2B interactions with their business partners. This will continue to fuel the so-called &lsquo;API economy.&rsquo; However, that's not all; in fact, the best is still to come. APIs are increasingly key to application strategies and effective application governance.&rdquo; (Source: Gartner, Basic API Management Will Grow Into Application Services Governance, Paolo Malinverno, Oct. 28, 2014)</p>
<p>Behind every API is a service. The&nbsp;<a title="Red Hat JBoss Middleware" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRoYXQuY29tL2VuL3RlY2hub2xvZ2llcy9qYm9zcy1taWRkbGV3YXJl">Red Hat JBoss Middleware</a>&nbsp;portfolio provides a platform for the development, integration, and deployment capabilities that are needed to build software services that can be exposed as APIs. The joint offering establishes a trusted relationship between the API provider and API consumers in a lightweight, flexible, and open standards-based package. This trusted relationship helps businesses more quickly create new value and growth from existing data, services, and content.</p>
<p>3scale&rsquo;s API Management Platform complements Red Hat&rsquo;s middleware tools with features such as access control, analytics, and portals for developers and partners. The 3scale platform integrates with Red Hat&rsquo;s traditional on-premises middleware portfolio, as well as its cloud-based development tools in&nbsp;<a title="JBoss xPaaS Services for OpenShift" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3BlbnNoaWZ0LmNvbS94cGFhcw==">JBoss xPaaS Services for OpenShift</a>.</p>
