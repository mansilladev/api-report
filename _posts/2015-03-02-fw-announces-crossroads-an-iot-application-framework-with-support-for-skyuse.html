<p><a href="http://www.feeneywireless.com/">FW, a leader in Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and software development</a>, today announced the availability of Crossroads with support for Skyus-E in March 2015. Crossroads is an adaptable, secure, end-to-end IoT application framework designed to monitor, analyze and report the intersection of machine data and human action.</p>
<p>Crossroads plays an instrumental role in simplifying the fragmentation businesses experience in the IoT marketplace. With an advanced data aggregation engine, Crossroads works as an autonomous client through API level integration, pulling real-time data from IoT network ecosystems. It helps to accelerate IoT platform development, find new trends, and make big data analysis more efficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since day one, our goal with Crossroads has been to maximize our customer&rsquo;s IoT experience by presenting only information relevant to a user; regardless of hardware, carrier or market vertical,&rdquo; said Ethan Ralston, CEO at FW.</p>
<p>A browser-based application, similar in concept to a mobile phone operating system, supports an ecosystem of IoT specific applications called widgets. Every widget is purpose built, designed to visualize the information that matters most, supporting decisions as you wade through a diverse set of data points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited to have out of the box support in Crossroads for the newest member of the Skyus family, the Skyus-E. Users have the ability to monitor the health and status of their device, with over the air configuration coming shortly,&rdquo; said Justin Bloom, Chief Technology Officer. Skyus-E is an intelligent gateway to the Internet of Things. Optimized for reliable 24/7 operation, the Skyus-E is based on FW&rsquo;s Skyus embedded modem kit which is packaged into a compact, rugged aluminum housing with tool-free mounting. The modular, field upgradable design supports 3G and 4G LTE /XLTE networks. Equipped with an Ethernet interface, the Skyus-E is easy to connect and accelerates time-to-market for creating connected devices.</p>
<p>With the ability to rapidly develop new widgets, and a suite of them readily available out of the box, such as Skyus-E Manager, Support Chat, and ProReports, FW&rsquo;s managed services visualization tool, Crossroads scales to fit any organization&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>FW is a team of makers with big ambitions on a mission to connect things. As an IoT products and services company, FW specializes in fixed and mobile cellular-based wireless solutions. FW creates IoT systems that collect meaningful intelligence to help people do their jobs more effectively. Whether it is an oil field worker, police officer on the street, or fleet owner, FW provides the technology behind their daily operations.</p>
