<p><a href="http://www.junxure.com">Junxure</a>, a leading CRM solutions provider for financial advisors that integrates technology, consulting, and training, today announced that Junxure Cloud recently surpassed 1,000 users on its comprehensive, cloud-based CRM platform for advisors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"In less than one year since its release, we've seen tremendous growth with Junxure Cloud," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Greg Friedman</span>, President of Junxure. "That momentum, coupled with the ongoing positive feedback from advisory firms and industry experts, continues to affirm our goal of delivering the most comprehensive cloud-based CRM on the market."</p>
<p>In addition to its intuitive navigation and industry-focused features, Junxure Cloud firms have noted an easy and time-effective onboarding experience without the need for cost-intensive overlays. Advisors also appreciate the CRM's flexibility to scale to any firm, from small to large, from previous Junxure on-premise users to firms switching from another platform, to firms with no CRM. Junxure Cloud's aggressive roadmap of deeper integrations with portfolio management, financial planning, document management, and custodial platforms has also resonated with firms.</p>
<p>"Early in the development process of Junxure Cloud we made the decision to build an application program interface (API) into the architecture," said Friedman. "This API enables us to respond quickly to industry demand for more meaningful integrations, essentially enabling the platform to evolve along with our customers."</p>
<p>Junxure Cloud's API and unique infrastructure have helped increase the frequency of future updates to a monthly release schedule. In addition, the company's flagship CRM platform &ndash; Junxure &ndash; also increased its release schedule, with its most recent update focused on increasing firm productivity. Enhancements include a new integration (SunGard's WealthStation financial planning application), more flexibility for bringing in revenue data with a new import tool and a key group of user experience enhancements.</p>
<p>"Technology today needs to keep up with the changing needs of an advisor," Friedman said. "We were deliberate in changing our approach to releases to ensure we continue to deliver what advisors need today and keep an eye on what they'll need tomorrow."</p>
<p>To celebrate Junxure Cloud's 1,000-user milestone, Junxure recently announced a free 60-day trial to all advisory firms interested in learning more about Junxure Cloud.</p>
<p>"We want to give all advisors the opportunity to try Junxure Cloud, as we are firm believers of 'seeing is believing,'" said Friedman. "Along with our new API, we continue to deliver more meaningful features more often. Our March release, for example, included two highly anticipated integrations, Junxure Cloud with Schwab OpenView Gateway<span>&trade;</span>&nbsp;and with TD Ameritrade Institutional's VEO<span>&reg;</span>. There is a lot of excitement in 2015, and we look forward to sharing this with our growing community of customers."</p>
