<p><a href="http://www.avalara.com">Avalara, Inc.</a>, a leading provider of cloud-based software delivering compliance solutions related to sales tax, VAT and other transactional taxes, today announced the launch of Avalara TaxRates API&trade;. This free API for developers integrates easily into web development projects to provide tax rate data in real time, allowing users to quickly access the most current sales tax rate information.</p>
<p>The TaxRates API is powered by Avalara&rsquo;s renowned tax content, which regularly updates changes in tax rates and tax boundaries. This provides an easy way for developers to use current sales tax rates in their projects, giving them a simple API to automate tax rate calculations for shopping carts, online marketplaces, and billing platforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only can developers get sales tax rates based on zip codes in the U.S., our TaxRates API also pinpoints precise tax jurisdictions based on a street address or latitude, longitude GPS coordinates,&rdquo; said Webb Stevens, vice president of product management at Avalara. &ldquo;Avalara&rsquo;s API provides the sales tax detail users need based on the location data a developer has handy - we think they&rsquo;re going to love it!&rdquo;</p>
