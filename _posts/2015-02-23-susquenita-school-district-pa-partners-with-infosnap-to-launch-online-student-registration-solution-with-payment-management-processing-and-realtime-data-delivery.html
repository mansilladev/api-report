<p>Susquenita School District in Duncannon, PA, partnered with InfoSnap to move student enrollment and registration online. <a href="https://www.infosnap.com/">InfoSnap&rsquo;s</a> award winning integration with PowerSchool, Susquenita&rsquo;s current student information system, will provide this district with a customized solution that will streamline new and annual student registration through seamless, real-time, on-demand data transfer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Registering students for school should be a simple process for families. We&rsquo;re looking to positively impact the amount of time and effort that our families and school administrators spend filling out and managing paperwork,&rdquo; said Susquenita&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Families who have more than one child within the district can &lsquo;snap&rsquo; data from one student to another. The use of SmartForm&trade; technology, an intuitive tool built into the solution, will collect relevant data based on previously entered information or choices (grade, activities, medical history, etc.). Data submitted by families will be reviewed and formatted to meet Susquenita School District&rsquo;s processes. This efficiency will improve the accuracy of information collected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technology continues to evolve and in recognizing that, we consider ourselves a forward-thinking district. Partnering with InfoSnap will streamline our processes in such a way that will provide our families and school staff with an innovative approach to student registration,&rdquo; said district administrators.</p>
<p>Susquenita School District is also considering the implementation of InfoSnap&rsquo;s Payment Management Service which will allow administrators to easily collect and report on all fees and donations at the time of form submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus far, we are really impressed with InfoSnap&rsquo;s user interface and the support they provide. We&rsquo;re not receiving a pre-packaged program, but one that is being designed and uniquely developed for our school district. Our solution is flexible to our needs and that&rsquo;s what ultimately led us to partner with InfoSnap,&rdquo; notes district leaders.</p>
<p>Susquenita&rsquo;s customized solution is being built with the PowerSchool API. This will allow school administrators to deliver data without exporting and importing files, resulting in real-time, on-demand data delivery. The solution will be available to families in the summer of 2015.</p>
