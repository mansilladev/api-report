<p>For many, the thought of making their home a "smart home" has been either too expensive, too confusing or simply unnecessary. But that is now going to change. <a href="https://www.neur.io/">Neurio</a>, an innovative, easy-to-use and money-saving smart home technology, today announced the availability of its flagship product that can, in minutes, make any ordinary home "smart."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neurio is an intelligent, open platform that with only one sensor brings smart home capabilities to the entire home, with future versions providing intelligence for all existing appliances. As the "brain of the home," Neurio connects both older appliances and newer "smart" devices to allow users to easily track, monitor and better understand how their home is operating, such as letting the user know when their kids come home, or if they forgot to turn something off before leaving for the day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Successfully funded via Kickstarter, Neurio is now shipping to backers and is currently available for pre-order at www.neur.io. The Neurio Sensor costs $249 and users have the potential to save money quickly by recognizing energy use patterns and habits. The Neurio platform, which features a single sensor attached to a home's circuit box, allows for home intelligence and monitoring right out of the box.&nbsp;<br /><br />Via the free Neurio iOS and Android apps, users are able to easily track power usage in real-time, to understand when and where energy is being used in the house, and ultimately save money by identifying where their energy dollars are being spent. Neurio's next major software update will be able to detect individual appliances to understand whether they are on or off. Other noteworthy future upgrades include sending users alerts to let them know things like when their laundry is done, if their hot water heater is acting abnormally, if their refrigerator stops working, or when the gaming console in a child's room is turned on, and more.&nbsp;<br /><br />"By only using a single device to smarten up the whole house, homeowners now have an affordable, yet powerful way to truly see how their home is operating, ultimately giving them peace of mind," said Ali Kashani, Co-Founder and CTO of Neurio. "Neurio monitors your home's electricity to figure out what your appliances are up to - without the need to install sensors on every device. It's time for the smart home of tomorrow to become the regular house of today, and Neurio is poised to lead the way."&nbsp;<br /><br />An Open Platform that Works with Other Smart Home Products&nbsp;<br /><br />Neurio is designed as an open platform to work hand-in-hand with other smart home products. Neurio makes other smart devices even smarter by providing real-time data and analysis about the home. Through Neurio's open API and integrations with 3rd party applications such as IFTTT and Spark, Neurio is encouraging developers, makers and hackers to create their own experiences with Neurio, ultimately providing consumers with an incredibly robust and beneficial platform.&nbsp;<br /><br />Neurio Makes it Easy and Affordable to Connect the Entire House&nbsp;<br /><br />Neurio is the only smart home product on the market that is able to connect to both "smart" and "non-smart/non-connected" appliances. With over 99% of all appliances in North American homes not currently connected to WiFi there has been no way to accurately monitor their behavior and measure their energy usage to give homeowners valuable and actionable insights regarding their home - until now. Neurio allows users to monitor individual appliances to care for their home and family, and gauge their energy use.&nbsp;<br /><br />Once the Neurio Sensor is installed on an electrical panel, it sends the data via WiFi to the cloud where the smart algorithms identify the unique power pattern by each device in real-time to tell whether a specific appliance is in use or off, and how much energy it consumes. Unlike other smart home systems, Neurio does NOT require that each appliance in the house be connected to a sensor. With Neurio, everything is monitored directly through the home's circuit box.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>About Neurio:&nbsp;</strong><br />Neurio is a leading home intelligence technology company that's turning the smart home market upside down. By using a single home sensor and some really smart cloud-based analytics, Neurio can monitor individual electrical appliances from inside a home's breaker panel without the need to install sensors on every device. Homeowners will finally know what's going on in their homes and gain better security, comfort and energy efficiency.&nbsp;<br /><br />In December 2014, Neurio secured CDN$1.5 million in seed funding led by BDC Venture Capital. This latest round of financing is being used to fuel the company's growth and transformation of the intelligent home marketplace by supporting the continued evolution of its innovative technology platform and the growth of the company's employee base.&nbsp;<br /><br />Neurio is headquartered in Vancouver, BC.
