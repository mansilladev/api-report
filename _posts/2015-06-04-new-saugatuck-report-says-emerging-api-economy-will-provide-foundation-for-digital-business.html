<p>The API Economy is central to Digital Business, as it provides a framework for understanding the interplay between various technologies such as Public and Private Cloud, Mobility, Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>But the API Economy is more than the APIs themselves. It depends on a combination of mutually reinforcing technologies. Although modern, simple APIs have helped to revolutionize data and service accessibility, new development methodologies like DevOps, new deployment technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, and the new application architecture called Microservices reinforce the need for, and benefits of, abstracting and managing small services, rather than large monolithic applications. Meanwhile, existing application portfolios have been slow to modernize, and are limiting companies&rsquo; ability to bring value to their customer across different channels and silos.</p>
<p>A new 20-page research report by <a href="http://saugatucktechnology.com/">Saugatuck Technology</a>, titled &ldquo;The API Economy: Foundation for Digital Business,&rdquo; provides a roadmap for how APIs have evolved and are being used today. It explains how APIs enable developers to gain access to services and data easily, without needing to understand or access the underlying systems, and how businesses benefit from streamlined integration, service reusability, and faster development. In such an environment, the API, rather than the application or service, becomes the focus of development, integration, and management. This enables companies to rely on data from their legacy applications, without having to go through costly rip-and-replace cycles &ndash; old services can be phased out one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;APIs provide a framework for allowing all different types of technologies to communicate over the Internet. They are critical for creating context-aware and cross-platform integrations that enable the Digital Business transformation,&rdquo; stated report author and Saugatuck Research Director Alex Bakker. &ldquo;Data tied up in legacy applications is often too far removed from the Digital Business value chain to be useful, but by enabling applications with APIs the data from these systems can be used to support Mobile, Cloud, and IoT initiatives.&rdquo;</p>
