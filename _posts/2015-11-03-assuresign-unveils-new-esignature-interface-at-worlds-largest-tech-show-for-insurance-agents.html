<p>Electronic signature provider, <a href="http://www.AssureSign.com">AssureSign</a>, today released new user interface features for both its enterprise and small business solutions. The new features include multiple e-signer profiles; live tracking of the e-signing progress and a drag-and-drop capability that propels AssureSign as the fastest e-signature process in the market. The news was announced during the 2015 Applied Net Client Network Conference, the world&rsquo;s largest gathering of insurance agents and brokers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AssureSign&rsquo;s new features also allow for multiple e-signers and e-signer profiles to track the e-signing progress, as well as in-line mark ups and editing. Uploaded documents are easy-to-save and can be used as customized templates for future clients. For frequent users, the drag-and-drop feature creates an e-signature document in just minutes, without sacrificing the security and deployment flexibility that its customers demand.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;These new features introduced today highlight AssureSign&rsquo;s ability to remain nimble and innovative as the electronic signature continues to evolve from an enterprise luxury to a basic business need,&rdquo; said AssureSign CEO David Brinkman. &ldquo;This reaffirms our commitment to providing e-signature solutions that offer the ultimate user experience without sacrificing the security and deployment flexibility that our users have come to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AssureSign&rsquo;s new interface will improve on its robust feature-set, which already includes form and field validation, customer branding/white labeling, notifications and reminder features, delayed signing (for franchises) and the capability to distribute signed documents to all parties. Additionally, AssureSign remains the only e-sign provider offering flexible deployment methods, which allow customers to launch the product via cloud, hybrid cloud or on-premise, depending on their unique IT infrastructure needs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AssureSign at Applied Net Conference <br />AssureSign&rsquo;s new user interface features come just as the company appointed insurance industry veteran Dianna George to general manager of global insurance solutions, underscoring the company&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the insurance industry.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Having worked in the industry for more than 15 years, I know that insurance agents are entrusted with sensitive information from their clients and are responsible for life-impacting decisions,&rdquo; said George, who has been apart of the Applied client network for more than a decade. &ldquo;They need a trustworthy, reliable e-signature solution to meet these needs. AssureSign has built long-lasting relationships with its insurance customers and today&rsquo;s news is an indicator that we&rsquo;re meeting the ever-changing needs of insurance agents and brokers nationwide. We are thrilled to have a presence at the 2015 Applied Net Client Network Conference and look forward to improving the insurance industry with these new features.&rdquo;</p>
