<p><a title="PubNub" href="http://www.pubnub.com/">PubNub</a>, the leading Data Stream Network, announced today that they will team with Atmel at CES 2015 to launch full SDK support for Atmel&rsquo;s MCU, MPU, and Wireless SoC platforms. Atmel developers now have access to PubNub&rsquo;s secure Publish/Subscribe messaging with guaranteed &frac14; second latencies across PubNub&rsquo;s 14 global points-of-presence. PubNub delivers secure communication through firewalls, proxy servers, and on unreliable mobile networks with a security model that guarantees no open ports on IoT devices.</p>
<p>Developers can now implement important features like remote device control, firmware upgrades, and device provisioning using PubNub&rsquo;s suite of IoT building blocks, including realtime device presence detection, stream storage &amp; playback, and data stream syndication. Show attendees will have the opportunity to experience the ease of use and flexibility of the modular solution through an innovative Connected Home demo in meeting place #MP25760 located in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center January 6-9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PubNub&rsquo;s realtime global data stream network combined with our embedded solutions helps IoT developers reduce time-to-market and solve the challenges of reliable IoT deployments,&rdquo; said Reza Kazerounian, SVP and GM of Microcontroller Business Unit at Atmel. &ldquo;By removing complexity and focusing on developer-centric tools and services, PubNub shares Atmel&rsquo;s philosophy of driving competitive advantage for our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Connected Home demo features an Atmel-based Arduino MCU that connects with the PubNub network, enabling it to send and receive realtime signals securely from external devices such as a mobile phone. With PubNub's low-latency global network, developers can remotely control Atmel-based embedded systems reliably and securely from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With easy-to-use SDKs for Atmel&rsquo;s platforms, IoT developers can now reap the benefits of realtime communication, and bypass the security pitfalls and configuration complexities that put IoT deployments at risk,&rdquo; said Todd Greene, founder &amp; CEO of <a href="/admin/blog/PubNub">PubNub</a>.</p>
