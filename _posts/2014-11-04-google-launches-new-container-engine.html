<p><span>Google just announced the alpha release of a new service called&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/" target="_blank">Google Container Engine</a>--p<span>owered by Kubernetes, Container Engine delivers a fully-managed cluster manager for Docker containers. Container Engine lets you get a Docker packaged application up and running quickly in a logical computing cluster. It frees you up from worrying about deploying to individual virtual machines and significantly reduces your operational burden while letting you develop in a far more agile fashion.</span><br /><br /><span>Container Engine has taken inspiration from the systems that run Google&rsquo;s internal workloads. While these systems were originally built to operate at unprecedented levels of scale and efficiency, the patterns they introduced are relevant to everyone. Container Engine allows you to break your application into smaller, atomic units that can be easily organized, managed and wired together. This enables all parts of your applicatioyn to effortlessly scale to any level you need. By adding the concept of a cluster (a large logical computer that stitches together lots of individual machines) and using Docker to package your application, Container Engine allows you to rapidly test and deploy your application. It takes care of scaling, monitoring and the health of your containers.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Google Container Engine groups together a set of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/" target="_blank">Google Compute Engine</a><span>&nbsp;VMs into a compute cluster that is managed for you. It lets you get the most out of your compute infrastructure and simplifies the development and deployment of distributed applications.&nbsp;</span>This is an Alpha release and although it isn&rsquo;t yet production-ready, Container Engine will continue to become richer and more powerful in the coming weeks and months. Because of the intense interest in containers and Kubernetes, we decided to open Container Engine up for everyone to give us feedback and help guide its development.</p>
<p><span>You can take the Container Engine for a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://cloud.google.com/container-engine" target="_blank">free test drive</a><span>&nbsp;and get the details you need with our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs" target="_blank">technical docs</a><span>. If you want to participate in one of the early customer programs for Container Engine, you can&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/10h7vBNZeusl7wwXvTxK3xQLVEi8n4WlII8Z7ZpHIvmY/viewform" target="_blank">sign up here</a><span>. These programs will directly connect you with the engineering team to help shape the future of the product, and give early support for production use.</span></p>
