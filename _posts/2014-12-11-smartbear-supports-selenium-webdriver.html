<p><span><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, the choice of more than two million software professionals for building and delivering the world&rsquo;s best applications, supports Selenium WebDriver, an open source automation tool with one of the largest user communities in the software development world. New versions of SmartBear&rsquo;s TestComplete and QAComplete now integrate with Selenium WebDriver, allowing teams to get more value from their Selenium tests and deliver Web applications with higher quality and faster time to market.</span><br /><br /><span>Open source tools, particularly Selenium and SmartBear&rsquo;s SoapUI, have gained significant user adoption over the past few years. Selenium is platform-agnostic, offers multi-browser support, and quickly and easily works with various integrated development environments (IDEs). These capabilities make Selenium appealing to development teams for test automation and unit testing of their Web applications.</span><br /><br /><span>On the other hand, the pressures of iterative testing in an agile or continuous delivery environment drives quality assurance (QA) teams to use tools that are easier to use and offer higher levels of abstraction for testing application business logic. When used by itself, Selenium typically does not fit the needs of both developers and testers and can make it challenging to achieve a high degree of collaboration and automation. Close collaboration between development and QA professionals becomes even more essential when releasing high quality software products in shorter release cycles, particularly when driven by continuous integration practices.</span><br /><br /><span>Additionally, relying only on Selenium can make it difficult to implement the test management practices that allow a strategic approach in an agile and DevOps environment. Testers can be hindered in their effort to prioritize testing of key features, trim down unnecessary tests, account for risk and determine test coverage.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We currently use TestComplete to automate our regression tests and improve end user browser experience,&rdquo; said Dana Mohapl, Senior Test Automation Developer at Igloo Software. &ldquo;We also utilize WebDriver automation and some other unit test tools, depending on the type of tests we automate. The new TestComplete WebDriver Integration is very beneficial as it allows us to reuse and extend our scripts, while leveraging all the benefits of TestComplete. The built-in TestComplete reporting gives us more time to code on actual tests as we don't have to search for or develop reporting libraries. Finally, the screen shots provided by TestComplete help us better understand why a Selenium WebDriver test failed. This integration allows developers to better collaborate with experienced testers to produce a robust automated solution.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>With TestComplete and QAComplete integration to Selenium WebDriver, SmartBear allows developers and testers to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerate release testing cycles by making it easy to reuse Selenium tests created on different platforms. Companies can thereby achieve higher levels of automation with less time spent on creating and maintaining Selenium scripts.</li>
<li>Significantly improve code quality using in-depth reports generated with TestComplete and QAComplete based on more data relating to coverage and quality, which in turn ensures tests exist for all functions and methods.</li>
<li>Increase scalability of Selenium tests and enable execution from the cloud or virtual machines using SmartBear TestExecute.</li>
<li>Gain a consolidated view of all their testing efforts, including manual as well as automated tests. A cross-project view not only provides testers with greater insight into test case prioritization, but also enables them to check for traceability between requirements, manual test cases, Selenium automated code and defects.</li>
<li>Have enhanced support of additional unit testing frameworks including JUnit, NUnit, TestNG, PyUnit, Ruby and PHPUnit.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>&ldquo;Selenium is becoming the standard for Web browser automation testing as it has the support of all the major Web browser developers,&rdquo; said Dennis Callaghan, Senior Analyst at 451 Research. &ldquo;The reusability, test management and reporting capabilities provided in SmartBear's new product releases build upon the massive automation benefits Selenium already provides.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;There are a lot of things that the Selenium WebDriver Project does well and there are a lot of things that it doesn&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; said Jim Evans, one of the core contributors to the Selenium project and the man behind the Selenium Internet Explorer Driver, and .Net bindings. &ldquo;The developers of WebDriver project have decided they are not terribly interested in providing these solutions. Things like test case tracking, reporting, pass fail analysis and longitudinal analysis of historical test trends are things that the WebDriver project has really never made any attempt to solve. And it&rsquo;s the place where very often a commercial automation vendor would excel and do a lot better than something that our open source folks would be able to come up.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>For more information on QAComplete 9.9.5, visit:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://smartbear.com/product/test-management-tool/qacomplete/.">http://smartbear.com/product/test-management-tool/qacomplete/<span>.</span></a><br /><span>For more information on TestComplete 10.5, visit:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/.">http://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/<span>.</span></a></p>
