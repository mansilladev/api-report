<p><a href="http://www.matrox.com/graphics">Matrox Graphics Inc.</a> today announced Matrox Mura&trade; IPX Series, a new line of 4K capture and IP encode/decode boards that let OEMs and AV system builders deliver advanced video wall controllers featuring high-quality, low-bitrate, multi-channel 4K or HD encoding and decoding over standard IP. The first two Mura IPX Series cards will be introduced at InfoComm 2015 (Orlando, June 17-19, booth 4053).</p>
<p>Designed to work with Mura MPX video wall capture and display boards and Matrox C-Series&trade; multi-display graphics cards, Mura IPX packs 4K capture plus high-density encode and decode functionality onto a single PCIe&reg; card to simplify integration and reduce installation costs. The MURA-IPX-I4DF 4K capture and IP decode board provides four HDMI 1.4a inputs for direct high-resolution 4Kp30 or 2560x1600p60 capture plus H.264 decoding of 4Kp60 and up to three 4Kp30, sixteen 1080p30 or eight 1080p60 streams. The MURA-IPX-I4EF 4K capture and IP encode/decode board adds H.264 level 5.2 encoding to stream and record video wall content&mdash;including video wall sources, displays or regions-of-interest&mdash;anywhere on the network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new Mura IPX hardware, combined with the latest, easy-to-use APIs and Matrox MuraControl&trade; video wall management software, gives system integrators the essential building blocks to deploy advanced video wall controllers ideal for control rooms, digital signage, AV presentation systems, and more,&rdquo; said David Chiappini, vice president of research and development, Matrox Graphics. &ldquo;OEMs can take advantage of our development-grade libraries that provide deep control over product customization and come complete with sample code and dedicated OEM development support.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>InfoComm 2015 Debut </strong><br />In an <a title="Matrox IPX InfoComm Demo Diagram" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYXRyb3guY29tL2dyYXBoaWNzL21lZGlhL3BkZi9wcm9kdWN0cy9JUF9lbmNvZGVfZGVjb2RlX2JvYXJkcy9tdXJhX2lweF9zZXJpZXMvaW5mb2NvbW1fZGVtb19kaWFncmFtLnBkZg==">interactive demonstration</a> in the Matrox booth 4053, Mura IPX will capture baseband and IP sources as Mura MPX video wall processor cards power a 2x2, 1920x1080 installation. Sources include Matrox Maevex decoders as well as Full HD Maevex encoder and 1080p60 Panasonic IP camera streams. Mura IPX will also encode the outputs in the same controller system, then, in a separate appliance, decode them alongside content originating on a C-Series-powered video wall. The decoded content will ultimately be displayed on a single C680-powered UHD monitor, illustrating the ability to stream and monitor (or record) an entire video wall anywhere on the network.</p>
