<p><a href="http://www.manahealth.com/">Mana Health</a>, a technology company that creates data-driven solutions for healthcare, announced today the availability of its&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.manahealth.com/manacloud-unified-data-platform/" target="_blank">ManaCloud</a>&nbsp;Platform, a secure, HIPAA-compliant cloud platform that unifies electronic medical records (EMRs) with patient-generated data and offers a developer-friendly Application Programming Interface (API) to support authorized access. The launch comes on the heels of the recently announced Meaningful Use&mdash;Stage 3 (MU-3) proposed rule, which requires the use of API for sharing data with patients and making available patient-generated data to providers along the continuum of care.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to offer ManaCloud at the exact moment the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) set down the MU-3 requirement for API access to health records," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Chris Bradley</span>, CEO and co-founder of Mana Health. "Health information exchanges (HIEs), hospitals and health systems can now leverage the deep investment Mana Health has made in unified data infrastructure to enhance patient data access, care coordination, and chronic care management."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ManaCloud was developed as a way to integrate the many disparate data sources that surround a patient to capture critical information that can support the shift to value-based care. The platform allows for the input and integration of patients' clinical data from existing EMRs while adding patient-generated data from apps and connected devices such as weight, pain levels, pulse, heart rate, exercise and calories. All of this data is then made available through an extensible API that makes it easy and cost-effective to deliver applications that can accelerate the industry-wide movement toward value-based care.</p>
<p>ManaHealth is also announcing the availability of ManaCloud within&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hasatx.org/" target="_blank">Healthcare Access San Antonio (HASA)</a>, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">San Antonio, Texas</span>-based HIE reaching more than two million consumers and providers within some 40 hospitals. ManaCloud is currently launched within the HASA network, powering the Mana Health&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.manahealth.com/patient-gateway/" target="_blank">Patient Gateway</a>, its meaningful use-certified patient portal.</p>
<p>"Since launching HASA services in 2011, we've steadily worked towards providing our members with applications that easily bring together and present data from multiple sources," said Gijs Van Oort, CEO and Executive Director, HASA. "By making the ManaCloud API available to our members, we can help them launch new and required services more cost effectively and help speed the transition to a more accountable healthcare system."</p>
<p>Key features of the ManaCloud platform include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Secure, HIPAA-compliant cloud-based platform with multiple layers of data protection</li>
<li>Developer-friendly RESTful,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">JSON API</span>&nbsp;and Mobile SDK</li>
