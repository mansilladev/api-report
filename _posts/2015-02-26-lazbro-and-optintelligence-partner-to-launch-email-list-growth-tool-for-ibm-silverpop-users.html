<p><a href="http://lazbro.com/">LazBro, Inc</a>., a full-service digital marketing agency and technology company, and <a href="http://www.opt-intelligence.com/">Opt-Intelligence</a> (OI), the leading email list growth provider, today announced Grow My List, a new product that enables IBM Silverpop customers to more effectively grow and manage their email subscriber databases via an opt-in advertising media buying module. The platform enables marketers to send targeted email communications to individuals engaging with the brand for the first time.</p>
<p>The new feature combines OI's roots in email list growth services and LazBro's Email Playground Platform, a tool that allows non-technical team members to create and schedule emails to send from the Silverpop platform. With the addition of the Grow My List tool to Email Playground, Silverpop customers are now empowered to grow their lists at regional or national levels, a model that can be especially beneficial to franchise-based organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"New email subscribers are a key component of successful digital marketing programs," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Loren McDonald</span>, Vice President of Industry Relations at Silverpop, an IBM company. "It's imperative that databases do not remain stagnant, as new subscriptions can result in new revenue. Prior to acquiring an individual's email address, marketers are limited in ways they can interact with an audience. By offering new ways for prospective customers to subscribe &ndash; opposed to something like the traditional newsletter sign-up &ndash; individuals interested in a brand are more likely to engage. The way customers and prospects interact with businesses has changed, so the way marketers engage should shift as well."</p>
<p>"Email Playground is especially useful for organizations with distributed workforces or franchisees that want to allow their teams to independently manage their local and regional marketing efforts," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Jennifer Lazarus</span>, President of LazBro. "The Grow&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">My List</span>module allows corporate marketing departments to empower their franchisees by providing a tool for managing their local and regional media buying."</p>
<p>OI enables technology partners and email service providers to offer advanced email list growth capability directly to their clients. The OI API includes ad creation and offer tools, auto responder welcome emails, plus detailed reporting and data transfer for new subscribers.</p>
<p>"Opt-Intelligence helps business of all sizes seeking ways to add scale to their email marketing efforts," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Craig Anderson</span>, President and COO of Opt-Intelligence. "As marketing departments continue to become de-siloed, it's necessary for teams to leverage ways to work more collaboratively."</p>
<p>"As the producer of more than 40 home show events across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">North America</span>, it is critical for us to find new ways to extend our reach and expand our audience," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Joanne Carry</span>, Digital Marketing Director at Marketplace Events. "The Grow My List feature will help use more effectively reach our demographic using Opt-Intelligence's email subscriber acquisition, allowing us to deliver even more targeted and individualized email communications via the Silverpop platform."</p>
