<p><em>Dealers Get Access to Developer-Friendly API With Flexible Payment Processing</em></p>
<p>Clearent, one of the nation&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.clearent.com/about/">fastest growing&nbsp;credit card processing companies</a>, today announced a partnership with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsale.net/">MicroSale</a>&nbsp;that integrates credit card processing with Version 9 of MicroSale&rsquo;s restaurant software solution.</p>
<p>MicroSale dealers now have the option to use Clearent as their integrated payment processor when selling Version 9. Because Clearent is a complete payment processor that connects directly to the card associations, dealers can eliminate the middleman and will receive numerous benefits that are typically not available through larger legacy payment processors.</p>
<p>Because Clearent built its processing platform from the ground up, dealers will have the flexibility they need to offer their merchants competitive rates and win more business. Additionally, Clearent offers next day funding with an 11:00 Eastern cut off time, which is one of the latest in the industry. This means that restaurateurs and other business owners in the hospitality industry can batch out later and get their money faster. Clearent was founded on the premise of providing full transparency and no hidden fees and offers generous revenue share programs. MicroSale dealers and merchants also benefit by receiving access to best-in-class online reporting tools with easy-to-read graphical reports that are updated daily and businesses with multiple locations can track their performance across all locations.</p>
<p>MicroSale is known for its &ldquo;smart&rdquo; modifier technology, quick combo functionality for quick service restaurants, table management, built in time clock with time validation, inventory, and multi-unit management controls. Version 9 includes features such as consolidated phone ordering, a friendlier, more efficient delivery module, customized pizza half names and free integration for delivery directions.</p>
<p>When asked about the company&rsquo;s recent integration to Clearent, Ken Willis, Vice President of MicroSale said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to give our dealers the ability to integrate to a true payment processor. This will help them make sure they&rsquo;re not leaving money on the table so they can grow their business faster. As for the integration, it was quick and simple thanks to Clearent&rsquo;s easy-to-understand documentation and robust code samples, and the level of support that we&rsquo;ve received from the entire Clearent team is outstanding.&rdquo;</p>

I get a direct relationship for quick turn around with honest pricing and support, the fastest funding for my clients, marketing support, and a partner who helps strengthen my monthly income while keeping attrition low.&rdquo;</p>
