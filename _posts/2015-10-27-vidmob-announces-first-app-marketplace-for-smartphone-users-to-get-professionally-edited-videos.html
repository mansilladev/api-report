<p><a href="http://www.vidmob.com">VidMob</a> today announced that the company will soon launch the first app marketplace for getting professionally edited videos made from the photos and videos on smartphone devices. The VidMob app works by allowing the user to easily send their videos and photos, in addition to external media from friends or cloud services like DropBox, to the company&rsquo;s private cloud servers. The app then presents the user with a wide range of experienced video editors from around the world who have bid on editing the video for them&mdash;making it amazingly simple for anyone with a smartphone to get professionally edited videos, fast. The app is also perfect for business owners looking for a cost-effective way to generate the quality video content needed to fill their social media channels.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As an app marketplace similar to Uber and Airbnb, VidMob aims to generate thousands of jobs for talented editors around the world. With no geographic constraints, editors can literally work whenever they want, wherever they want, as much as they want, and charge whatever their time is worth.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Alex Collmer, founder and CEO of VidMob, has spent his career working at the intersection of traditional creative businesses and emerging technology. He began VidMob after building Autumn Games, one of the premier Indie games publishers. VidMob&rsquo;s genesis, however, came after Collmer witnessed the staggering rise of mobile device penetration firsthand and came to a critical realization: that soon billions of people would have videos stuck in their device&rsquo;s camera rolls, and how much better that video would be if it was professionally edited.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Video is becoming the medium through which with the world communicates, and we think that the potential impact of unlocking the massive volume of abandoned media on mobile devices is quite exciting,&rdquo; said Collmer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the opportunity for people to easily and affordably create a video that makes them laugh, or cry, or reminisce, or tell their story&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;more effectively. But even more exciting, though, is the potential to impact many people&rsquo;s lives positively by creating millions of flexible, rewarding jobs for editors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VidMob&rsquo;s initial seed round has attracted participation from Foundation Capital and Acadia Woods Partners, as well as leading current and former executives from high profile media companies such as Warner Bros., Creative Artists Agency, Activision, AMC Network Television, Facebook, Tumblr, Oculus VR, Pearson Education and others, as well as the venture arm of one of the world&rsquo;s largest independent advertising agencies, Mother New York.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VidMob intends to be more than just an app; it&rsquo;s a platform for easy professional video creation across many touch points. As more and more companies transition from text to video in their own offerings, VidMob&rsquo;s set of open API&rsquo;s enable simple and affordable Video-as-a-Service (&ldquo;VaaS&rdquo;) integration for easy video creation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;In addition to all of the consumer use cases, VidMob could be used to create videos of homes for sale on real estate websites, videos for profiles on dating sites, video resumes on job sites, and much, much more. VidMob wants to be behind the scenes working with partners to power the creation of these videos with incredible ease, and through that, to help them further build their own businesses and thus deepen overall consumer engagement,&rdquo; added Collmer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VidMob expects to launch soon for iOS, followed by Android.</p>
