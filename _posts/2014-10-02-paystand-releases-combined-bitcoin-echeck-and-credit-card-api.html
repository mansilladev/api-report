<p>Payment provider <a href="http://www.paystand.com/">PayStand</a> has released a new payment API that allows developers to accept Bitcoin, eCheck and credit cards through a single API service. There are numerous providers who enable eCheck and credit cards, but very who are accepting Bitcoin as well.</p>
<p>PayStrand describes their new service:</p>
<blockquote><em>"The PayStand API is providing developers the opportunity to build any type of payment experience on top of the PayStand solution, so they can be innovative and creative in their approach to payments, taking advantage of Bitcoin, eCheck and credit card options. Developers are also happy to take advantage of the lowest rates offered through the payment API, given the nature of our unique Payments as a Service and wholesale rates business model." said Jeremy Almond, CEO, PayStand.</em></blockquote>
<p>PayStand provides all the characteristics of a modern web API, with REST, OAuth, and JSON, and also provides mobile SDKs, and checkout and purchase buttons, and other embeddable tools.</p>
