<p><a href="http://www.vigilanzcorp.com/vi">VigiLanz</a>, a digital healthcare intelligence firm headquartered in Minneapolis, today unveiled its open, interoperable enterprise intelligence resources (EIR) software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform at HIMSS 2015 Annual Conference in Chicago. VigiLanz announced that its EIR platform incorporates services-oriented architecture (SOA) and open application programming interface capability (API) to aggregate and interact with disparate data throughout the healthcare enterprise and any of its software services, including EMRs to third-party best-of-breed vendors, to deliver real-time insights and intelligence via actionable alerts and predictive analytics to executives and frontline clinicians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;Clinicians and administrators can now rapidly integrate new clinical and business information real-time for better decision-making and, most importantly, for improved patient care with VigiLanz&rsquo; EIR&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The VigiLanz EIR platform complements a hospital&rsquo;s EMR enterprise workflow and documentation system,&rdquo; said VigiLanz Chairman and CEO, David Goldsteen M.D. &ldquo;For more than 10 years we&rsquo;ve been supporting many leading healthcare clients with real-time information, surveillance and intelligence. Today, we are opening up the market&rsquo;s first real-time SaaS EIR platform capable of integrating and aggregating massive volumes of our clients&rsquo; primary data generated by the EMR and other point solutions, and combine it with VigiLanz metadata that is uniquely processed by our proprietary, crowd-sourced, and evidence-based smart-rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Goldsteen also announced that VigiLanz is actively participating with the Health Level Seven (HL7) standards organization on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) initiative. FHIR is an industry-wide effort to create future data standards to accommodate healthcare interoperability and efficient exchange of electronic health information. &ldquo;Our shared vision with clients for real-time, open and interoperable healthcare is driving VigiLanz&rsquo; platform direction and development,&rdquo; said Dr. Goldsteen. &ldquo;We are working with our leading healthcare institutions on the FHIR initiative as well as now making our web services API available to achieve this vision as rapidly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Dr. Goldsteen, VigiLanz&rsquo; EIR platform features an abstract data model that enables easy and efficient management of any dataset in the healthcare enterprise. &ldquo;Our clinical intelligence and EIR platform services provide capability to rapidly implement solutions that ingest and normalize disparate system data from the EMR and elsewhere and then interface these data with highly robust exception-based, temporal rules, algorithms, and events to deliver numerous real-time clinical and business intelligence services within the VigiLanz workflow or as part of an enterprise documentation system workflow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The VigiLanz EIR architecture and data model is uniquely flexible in its ability to interact with data types well beyond the typical lab and demographic information. VigiLanz incorporates important data elements that are linked to real time bedside interactions, device and medication utilization as well as select non-clinical data sources. Normalization of these important data elements&nbsp;results in transactional data that more closely aligns with the specific elements that are important to key areas of medication safety, adverse event prevention, infection prevention, healthcare costs, sepsis, DVT prevention, CDIFF and impacts around length of stay, mortality and readmission rates, assuring more targeted opportunities towards improving patient outcomes.
