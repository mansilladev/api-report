<p><a href="http://www.nexcom.com">NEXCOM</a> has collaborated with IBM&reg; to help manufacturers delve into big data using analytic applications in the cloud. Sweeping the industrial and manufacturing sector, big data is catalyzing the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). In response to the momentous wave of digital transformation, the collaboration between NEXCOM and IBM&reg; is aimed to facilitate the use of big data harnessed from industrial IoT to allow for more data-driven decision-making.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The industrial and manufacturing sector sees big data as a tool to increase efficiency, reduce cost and waste, and explore new business models. As different clients have different agendas, it requires a configurable IoT gateway solution with flexibility in everything from data acquisition to data analysis in order to quickly respond to all clients&rsquo; needs. This is the essence of the IBM&reg; and NEXCOM collaboration.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;With expertise in industrial network communication, NEXCOM has broken barriers to multi-protocol data acquisition from a plethora of manufacturing equipment and field devices, while leveraging IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; enables NEXCOM to create a Connect-to-Cloud (C2C) software engine with ease. For the purposes of data analytics, archiving and others, the C2C software engine&mdash;built with Node-RED along with APIs on IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade;&mdash;employs the &ldquo;software-defined data path&rdquo; method for provisioning and configuring connections between edge devices and cloud applications,&rdquo; said YC Cheng, Assistant Vice President of NEXCOM&rsquo;s IoT Automation Business Group.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; is the cloud platform that helps developers rapidly build, manage and run web and mobile applications. It also enables developers to embrace development and operations, and extend existing IT investments with cloud integration services.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Under the partnership, NEXCOM has developed the&nbsp;NIO 100&nbsp;series in which industrial IoT, big data, and cloud services come together as a cloud-ready IoT gateway solution. The solution provides a web-based user interface for not only software-defined data path, but also remote asset management. With a few clicks, drags, and drops, manufacturing machine vendors can start managing on-site machines, processing field data, and handling local events, making possible predictive maintenance for instance. End users, such as factory operators, can benefit from the reduction in unexpected operation interruption.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;NEXCOM has a worldwide client base. Working with a global technology service company like IBM brings several gains,&rdquo; added Cheng. &ldquo;IBM&rsquo;s broad domain knowledge and datacenters around the globe are as important factors as massive development support to NEXCOM.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About&nbsp;</strong><strong>NEXCOM</strong><br />Founded in 1992, NEXCOM integrates its capabilities and operates six global businesses, which are Multi-Media Solutions, Mobile Computing Solutions, IoT Automation Solutions, Network and Communication Solutions, Intelligent Digital Security, and Medical and Healthcare Informatics. NEXCOM serves its customers worldwide through its subsidiaries in five major industrial countries.
