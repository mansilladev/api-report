<p><a href="http://www.fintechsandbox.org">FinTech Sandbox</a> Executive Director Jean Donnelly announced today that Estimize is joining other leading providers of financial data in offering its data free of charge to startups selected to participate in this unique program.  FinTech Sandbox startups will have API access to Estimize&rsquo;s corporate earnings and revenue estimates for 1,500 domestic equity securities and 26 separate economic indicators crowdsourced from over 10,000 contributors, including thousands of buy- and sell-side analysts. Estimize is planning to expand its offering of economic forecasts to the international arena in the very near future.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About Estimize </strong><br />Estimize crowdsources corporate earnings and revenue estimates from the sell-side, the buy-side, and from independent contributors such as academics, private investors, and students.
