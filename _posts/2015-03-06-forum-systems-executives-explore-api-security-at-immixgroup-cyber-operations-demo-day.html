<p><a href="http://www.forumsys.com/" target="_blank">Forum Systems Inc.</a>, provider of the&nbsp;industry-leading API and cloud security gateway, Forum Sentry, today announced that its Chief Technology Officer,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Jason Macy</span>, and Director of Sales,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Randy Gardner</span>, will be presenting at immixGroup's Cyber Operations Demo Day.&nbsp;Their session, "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://events.immixgroup.com/Cyber-Ops-Demo-Sessions" target="_blank">Modernizing Cybersecurity with API Security Gateways</a>," will be held on<span class="xn-chron">Thursday, March 12</span>&nbsp;at the Virginia Tech Research Center.</p>
<p>Government organizations are challenged by the contradictory dynamics of increasing access to internal systems while protecting critical business data. And the continued trends in mobile and cloud computing have led to new and ever-increasing threats, requiring agencies and organizations to establish effective modern security strategies.</p>
<p>During Cyber Operations Demo Day, Forum Systems executives will demonstrate the benefits of secure architecture design for agencies and organizations. Attendees will discover how they can leverage API security gateway technology to greatly improve security by consolidating access control with information assurance.</p>
<p>The event, hosted by Forum Systems partner&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.immixgroup.com/" target="_blank">immixGroup</a>, promises to offer government attendees from civilian, DoD, and state &amp; local agencies a hands-on look at the Forum Sentry API Gateway, which last October earned SC Magazine's prestigious "Recommended" designation and "Pick of the Litter" rating in the publication's&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.scmagazine.com/forum-systems-sentry-api-gateway/review/4286/" target="_blank">2014 NAC, IDM and DLP Group Test</a>. Processing and securing more than 10 billion transactions per day worldwide, Forum Sentry significantly reduces the cost and complexity of centralizing security, identity and governance for hundreds of global organizations, including some of the world's largest federal agencies, and is the industry's only FIPS 140-2 and NDPP-certified API Gateway for enabling secure connectivity between users, applications and the cloud.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to participate in Cyber Operations Demo Day," said Macy. "With continued expansion of the boundaries of information exchange, coupled with a constantly growing attack surface area, public sector networks are vulnerable to new and more sophisticated threats every day. More organizations are seeking best-in-class security protection, identity enforcement and transaction management across their channels, applications and infrastructure. And we look forward to showcasing the unique capabilities of Forum Sentry to deliver secure integration and enable ease of access without compromising security."</p>
