<p><a href="http://tagkast.com">Tagkast</a>, the Chicago-based social amplification tool for live events, announced today the release of Tagkast 2.0, the newest and most powerful version of their photo-marketing app. Built in compliance with Facebook&rsquo;s Graph API v2.2, Tagkast 2.0 will deliver an improved brand experience. The introduction of branded video and further optimization of the reach of branded content shared on social channels are among several new updates to the Tagkast platform.</p>
<p>Tagkast&rsquo;s event marketing software has helped major brands like Subaru of America and Pandora Internet Radio amplify their event sponsorship efforts. Using Tagkast, brands can engage event attendees, and inspire them to share real-time branded content to their personal social networks directly from the event.</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s Graph API v2.2 gives users more control over their privacy by allowing them to select which information is shared with brands when logging in to Facebook through third-party apps such as Tagkast. Tagkast 2.0 has been designed specifically for Graph API v2.2 and is guaranteed to work within Facebook&rsquo;s new user privacy settings and permissions through 2016. Tagkast 2.0 also boasts a more simplified and responsive user experience. The update allows for advanced brand saturation with customizable branding on every screen in which the attendee interacts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing event attendees a fun and easy way to capture and broadcast personal brand experiences gives event marketers a reliable way to drive natively placed, word-of-mouth endorsements on social media platforms,&rdquo; said Joe Matthews, CEO of Tagkast.</p>
<p>Tagkast 2.0 is also introducing video as a content medium. Like branded photos, video content will be candid, consumer-generated and shared organically on social media. All branded videos created on-site and shared through Tagkast will be seamlessly integrated across social platforms &ndash; Facebook, Twitter and Vine &ndash; to auto-play for a native-feel as users scroll through their news feeds.</p>
<p>Another new feature of Tagkast 2.0 is photographer performance ratings. Performance ratings are automatically calculated in the admin portal allowing brands to identify top Tagkast photographers. Ratings are calculated with a custom algorithm and can be sorted based on 3 key scores &ndash; Social Score representing the percentage of engagements shared to social media, Hustle Score indicating the number of guests engaged, and Tag Score showcasing the number of collective tags the operator was able to secure. Scoring will help brands leverage Tagkast more effectively to maximize the digital footprint of their event sponsorship.</p>
<p>In addition, Tagkast now includes advanced Social Influencer Tracking. When event attendees login to share brand experiences, the app will identify which attendees have larger than normal social followings. Tagkast photographers can then re-engage the identified social influencers throughout the event to significantly amplify the digital reach.</p>
<p>Lastly, Tagkast has expanded its event marketing product portfolio to include Green Screen Technology for further branding and background customization.</p>
