<p>The AWS Lambda Preview is now available to all AWS customers in the supported regions with no additional sign-up. Now you can just sign in to the&nbsp;<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Management Console</a>&nbsp;and get started using AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information. To learn more about AWS Lambda, visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">website</a>and you can get your first Lambda function up and running with a few clicks in the AWS Management console.</p>
