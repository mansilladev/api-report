<p>Prior to first introducing our&nbsp;<span class="il">pricing</span>&nbsp;last year, those of us on the <a href="https://www.respoke.io">Respoke</a> team surveyed some potential customers and did our best to provide a&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;introductory pricing model. While there were some things that we got right, there's nothing like talking to real customers and having the benefit of hindsight.&nbsp; We've heard your feedback and we'll soon be updating our&nbsp;<span class="il">pricing</span>&nbsp;tiers to reflect it.</p>
<p>First of all, our connection-based model continues to resonate with people, so that will be sticking around.&nbsp; However, the distribution of connections available at each level needs some adjustment.&nbsp; While our current offering is great at the low end, offering plans with 5, 20, or 100 concurrent connections, for larger projects the jump in connections from 100 to 1,000 and then to 10,000 is too wide for many of you.&nbsp; Our new plans will still start at 5 connections, but will take a more reasoned approach to match customer growth patterns, moving to 50, 250, and 1250 connections.&nbsp; For those that need more than 1250 simultaneous connections, a new "pay as you grow" model will provide a smoother ride as your needs increase.</p>
<p>Another area that needs to be revisited is the number of tiers.&nbsp; Today we offer six tiers, starting with free and ending with a "call us" option (that wasn't really obvious).&nbsp; After getting some valuable feedback, we're scaling that down to four options, which will still include a free plan and a "Call Us" option.&nbsp; Additionally, you may recall that our existing plans have cute names: Play, Go, Engage!, Expand, and Accelerate.&nbsp; While these are fun, it wasn't immediately obvious to people which plan should receive their attention, so we've changed the names to a more standard convention: Starter, Basic, Pro, and Enterprise.</p>
<p>In the next few days we'll be introducing these new&nbsp;<span class="il">pricing</span>&nbsp;tiers aimed at satisfying a greater number of our customers.&nbsp; The tiers will continue to be based on the maximum allowable simultaneous connections and total media relay used during the month.&nbsp; Certain tiers will also offer access to new functionality that we've introduced over the past couple of months such as inbound or outbound voice calls to the traditional phone network.</p>
<p>Here's how things will look in the not-so-distant future:</p>

<div><br />We really think that you'll find this new structure beneficial as you expand your use of Respoke.&nbsp; However, as you can see,&nbsp;<span class="il">prices</span>&nbsp;are changing as we consolidate tiers. If you're an extremely cost sensitive user of the Respoke service, then you may want to consider upgrading your current plan now before the new plans go into effect later this month.
<p>I want to thank you for the feedback that we've received to date.&nbsp; As you can see, we take all comments and suggestions seriously in an effort to provide the best communications platform possible.&nbsp; Please continue to send us any questions, comments, or suggestions that you have to the <a href="https://www.respoke.io">Respoke team</a>.</p>
