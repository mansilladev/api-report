<p><a href="http://www.glass.net/">Glass.net</a> recently implemented a new tool that allows its partner shops to order Pilkington glass directly through Glass.net. Shops that have signed up for the free partner program can use their shop portal on the Glass.net partner website to look-up and order Pilkington glass through Glass.net. The process is quick, user-friendly, secure, and prices are competitive.</p>
<p>Glass.net built the tool in cooperation with Pilkington, using their API (application programming interface), so that all search queries are populated with real-time data directly from Pilkington. When an auto glass shop places a glass order through Glass.net, the order is instantly and automatically submitted to Pilkington. If the order is for will-call, it will typically be ready for pickup in less than 30 minutes; if the order is for delivery, it will be placed on the next available delivery truck, often on the same day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited to roll this program out to our network of partner shops. Many people think that Glass.net is only about advertising, but in reality we are actively seeking ways to add value in several high-impact ways to both customers and suppliers in the auto glass industry. Giving auto glass replacement shops a streamlined way to order glass empowers them with more options and choices, which is good for both the industry, the consumer, and us,&rdquo; says Stephan Westcott, General Manager for Glass.net.</p>
<p>The new tool also streamlines processes for Pilkington. All orders are submitted automatically into Pilkington&rsquo;s systems on a single Glass.net account, thereby consolidating and simplifying the billing process.</p>
<p>Jon Sheets, Marketing Specialist for Pilkington, said, &ldquo;Pilkington is happy to supply the industry with OE quality glass products that safely bring glass technology to consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glass.net first offered this national buying program and tool to Independent Glass Association (IGA) members in May 2015.  Auto glass repair shops interested in the program can contact Glass.net to learn more.</p>
<p>Glass.net  is the nation&rsquo;s leading online auto glass marketplace, empowering consumers with instant auto glass replacement quotes from independent providers of vehicle glass repair and replacement services.  Glass.net, through its auto glass network, provides consumers with instant auto glass replacement quotes from high-quality local providers. This allows consumers to compare, contrast, and select the one that best fits their needs. Glass.net's nationwide network of quality independent auto glass specialists all offer free mobile service.
