<p>Visitors to the <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org">Indianapolis Museum of Art&rsquo;s</a> website can now explore more than 51,000 objects from the Museum&rsquo;s permanent collection in a revamped online database optimized for speed, user experience and mobile use.</p>
<p>The new online collection offers a visually rich platform with over 33,000 high-quality images available for viewing and high-res zooming capabilities to provide detailed views of assorted works. A hallmark of the new website is the 21,000 images now available for high-res download, providing open access to imagery for any personal, scholarly or commercial use. Multiple views of many three-dimensional works are also available to provide a unique online viewing experience for the site user.</p>
<p>The newly redesigned interface also includes advanced search capabilities, such as searching by color and a new &ldquo;You May Also Like&rdquo; feature, which provides recommendations for artworks related to your search. Interpretive content unique to the IMA, including videos and historical information, are now easily accessible for an enhanced user experience.</p>
<p>The new platform replaces the previous collections database created in 2010. The revamped online collection was created by the IMA Lab, the award-winning technology consulting arm of the Museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The IMA collection is one of our greatest assets and providing access to its entirety online is monumental,&rdquo; said Kyle Jaebker, director of the IMA Lab. &ldquo;This project required cross-institutional collaboration and represents the most complete and rich online collection experience we have offered to date. The open access policy, updated imagery and underlying data APIs will allow the museum and public to utilize the collection in new ways going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The IMA will continue to grow the imagery available for online viewing and download, and update the database regularly as new works are added to the collection.</p>
