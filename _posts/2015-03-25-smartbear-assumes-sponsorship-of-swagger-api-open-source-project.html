<p><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a><span>, the leading provider of open source API testing and development tools, has acquired the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a><span>&nbsp;API open source project from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://helloreverb.com/">Reverb Technologies</a><span>. Swagger is the leading API description format used by developers in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment to design and deliver APIs that fuel IoT, microservices and mobile applications in the connected world. With this acquisition, SmartBear is now the company behind the two most widely adopted API open source initiatives,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.soapui.org/">SoapUI</a><span>&nbsp;and Swagger.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>&ldquo;Swagger has been the clear leader of the API description format discussion for several years &ndash; its ecosystem and passionate community is unsurpassed in the field,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span><a href="http://se.linkedin.com/pub/ole-lensmar/1/472/a71">Ole Lensmar</a><span>, CTO at SmartBear. &ldquo;We look forward to working with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonytam">Tony Tam</a><span>, Swagger&rsquo;s creator, to give Swagger the dedicated backing and support it needs for growth, primarily to ensure the open source project&rsquo;s evolution but also to ease its adoption into enterprise scenarios.&rdquo;</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of RESTful APIs. With Swagger, API developers can easily deliver interactive documentation, client SDKs and discoverable APIs. With its powerful code generation capabilities and open source tools, Swagger makes it easy for developers to go from design to implementation in a short amount of time. Swagger helps leading technology companies and enterprises like Microsoft, IBM, Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Morningstar and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>&ldquo;Since first being released in 2011, Swagger has found broad adoption in start-ups, mid-size and enterprise companies alike&mdash;it has grown far beyond what we had envisioned,&rdquo; said Tony Tam, CEO at Reverb. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time to take Swagger to the next level and we have chosen to partner with SmartBear because they have the API expertise and proven commitment to open source with products like SoapUI. With SmartBear, Swagger will reach more developers, products and services, and make an even bigger impact on the API world.&rdquo;</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>SmartBear is committed to keeping the Swagger specification and code open and driven by the community, and encourages contributions through evangelism, documentation and tooling. The company is engaging industry leaders to create an open governance model that supports the evolution of the Swagger specification in a vendor-neutral and collaborative manner.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>As part of its commitment to Swagger, SmartBear will be investing in development to evolve the specification and toolset, as well as providing commercial support offerings for enterprises using Swagger. The company will also be developing and providing resources to help developers adopt and use Swagger and the Swagger tools.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>For more information, contact us at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:apiteam@swagger.io">apiteam@swagger.io</a><span>.
