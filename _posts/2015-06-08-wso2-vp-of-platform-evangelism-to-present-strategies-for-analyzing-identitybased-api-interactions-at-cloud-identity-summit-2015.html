<p>Understanding the identities of users accessing APIs exposes new business opportunities for teams looking to extend their business reach, enhance customer intimacy and increase revenue opportunities. At <a href="http://www.cloudidentitysummit.com/">Cloud Identity Summit 2015</a>, <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> Vice President of Platform Evangelism Chris Haddad will present how to monetize APIs by analyzing identity-based interactions. The conference is being held June 8-11, 2015 at the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines in San Diego, CA.</p>
<p>The session, &ldquo;Who is Accessing My API?&rdquo;, will run 1:45 p.m. &ndash; 2:10 p.m. as part of the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the API, Stupid&rdquo; track on Tuesday, June 9, 2015 in the Fairway Ballroom I. Chris will begin by examining how linking identity as a service (IDaaS), identity bridges, API gateways, and API analytics can help teams to drive business value. He then will explore how to establish a context-driven experience and effectively monetize APIs by analyzing identity-based interactions.</p>

He works closely with developers, architects, and C-level executives, as well as WSO2's engineering team, to increase adoption of WSO2 open source technology, improve the middleware platform, and maximize customer value.
