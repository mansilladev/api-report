<p>IntuiLab will proudly announce at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2lzZTIwMTUuY29tL2hvbWUucGhw">Integrated Systems Europe 2015</a>&nbsp;that the latest version of&nbsp;<a title="IntuiLab Homepage" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnR1aWxhYi5jb20=">IntuiFace</a>, their market leading platform for creating, deploying and measuring deeply interactive, expressive and connected digital experiences without writing code, now supports the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zYW1zdW5nLmNvbS91cy9idXNpbmVzcy9kaWdpdGFsLXNpZ25hZ2Utc29sdXRpb25zL2luZGV4Lmh0bWwjc21hcnRzaWduYWdlcGxhdGZvcm0=">Samsung SMART Signage Platform</a>. This is the first multi-touch signage creation option for the Samsung SSP, enabling businesses to invest in and realize the added benefits of interactive over passive signage. Live demonstrations of IntuiFace in action on the Samsung SSP can be found at ISE 2015 in Samsung&rsquo;s booth, 1-H20.</p>
<p>Built from the ground-up with multi-touch capabilities at its core, the IntuiFace platform enables businesses to create engaging, highly interactive experiences without coding that can be deployed within minutes on any touch-enabled Samsung SSP display. These touch-first experiences can incorporate a wide variety of media formats, an open connection to cloud-based data and APIs (including the Internet of Things), a broad range of expressive capability and all of the core requirements for successful signage deployments such as powerful analytics and scheduling.</p>
<p>The marriage between IntuiFace and the Samsung SSP is rooted in work by IntuiLab to port its&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tL3BhdGVudHMvVVM4MzkwNTc3">patented multi-touch gesture recognition engine</a>&nbsp;to run natively within the SSP&rsquo;s Web browser. The resulting HTML5-based runtime - complementing IntuiLab&rsquo;s previous work on Windows, iOS and Android &ndash; enables IntuiFace users and partners to access multi-touch experiences simply by entering a URL in the SSP browser.</p>
<p>The combination of these unique capabilities with the dramatically reduced total cost of ownership achieved by the SoC-based Samsung SSP creates a solution unmatched in the signage market for content creation, cost and speed of deployment. It is estimated that projects built with these two platforms reduce total cost of ownership by 65% and time-to-deployment by 50% over conventional display and content delivery approaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to offer our customers true multi-touch capability with the availability of IntuiFace on the touch-enabled Samsung SoC displays,&rdquo; said Vincent Piarou, senior business developer for digital touch signage solutions at Samsung&rsquo;s Enterprise Business Division. &ldquo;For organizations in search of an affordable, accessible path to creating multi-touch digital signage content &ndash; even organizations with no development skills - IntuiFace and Samsung SMART Signage Platform displays offer a uniquely compelling, turnkey package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Samsung SMART Signage Platform has a price point and ease of use that make interactive signage deployments &ndash; the natural evolution of passive signage &ndash; an obvious choice for businesses of any size,&rdquo; added Vincent Encontre, CEO, IntuiLab. &ldquo;Thanks to our technology partnership with Samsung, IntuiLab has been able to make interactive signage creation accessible as well. We believe consumers will be amazed at what can be achieved, triggering a significant increase in touch-based Samsung SSP projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Multi-touch experiences built using IntuiFace Composer can be published to a public or private cloud storage account and then downloaded and run on the Samsung SSP using IntuiFace Player. This new solution is available on February 10 with both a free option as well as a low cost annual subscription. Composer can be downloaded to a Windows PC and trialed for free without a time limit.
