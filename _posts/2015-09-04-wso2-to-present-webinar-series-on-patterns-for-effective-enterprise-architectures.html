<p class="responsiveNews">Innovation doesn&rsquo;t demand that technology professionals recreate the wheel. Instead, success often comes from creating new IT solutions that employ proven architectural patterns for solving common problems. WSO2 will present five webinars that explore how to leverage important architectural patterns to evolve their existing enterprise architecture (EA) and create new EA strategies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The WSO2 patterns webinar series will run September 3 &ndash; 17, 2015.

<p class="responsiveNews">September 3: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Service-oriented architecture (SOA) provides an architectural style and a set of principles to help align IT initiatives with business requirements. Business functions are modeled as well-defined services or APIs, and these definitions are standards-based, platform-neutral, and implementation-agnostic. This session will discuss how a SOA addresses enterprise application integration (EAI) by reducing the complexity of making enterprise applications work together and helping them to evolve faster. The webinar also will explain the key architectural goals of a SOA and how it can enable business efficiency. Additionally, the session will explore popular methods of SOA realization, such as Web services standards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Presenting the webinar will be Dassana Wijesekara, WSO2 solutions architect. The one-hour webinar will be held Thursday, September 3, from 10:00 a.m. &ndash; 11:00 a.m. PDT.

<p class="responsiveNews">September 8: Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Enterprise systems today are moving toward a more dynamic model as change has become the norm rather than the exception. Such systems need to be loosely coupled, autonomous, versatile and adaptive. This webinar will discuss how enterprises can use an event-driven architecture (EDA) to model and explain a dynamic enterprise system with. It will begin with an overview of EDA and then examine how an EDA can benefit the enterprise. Additionally, it will explain how the WSO2 product stack complements this architectural pattern.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Presenting the webinar will be Shiroshica Kulatilake, WSO2 solutions architect.

<p class="responsiveNews">September 10: Web-Oriented Architecture (WOA)</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The acronym may not be as widely used, but today the prevailing pattern for building a complete end-to-end Web application is a Web-oriented architecture (WOA)&mdash;basically SOA plus the World Wide Web and REST. This session will begin by discussing Gartner&rsquo;s original definition of WOA, as well as how a WOA identifies APIs, user interfaces, and application state as first-class components of an architecture. It then will look at how WOA has chance over the last decade and current development trends affecting WOA patterns. The session will then conclude with an overview of a WOA stack.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">September 15: Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA)</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">An organization is built on resources&mdash;from human capital to digital assets, services or products, among others&mdash;that often interact with each other to form a value chain. A resource-oriented architecture (ROA) serves an important role in modeling a way to interact with a resource in a secure manner to support such a value chain. The session will begin with a history of ROA and supporting technologies, such as distributed systems, the semantic Web, and RESTful services. It then will examine the current landscape along with the role of ROA in the realm of micro-services. Additionally, the webinar will review new developments around the architecture pattern.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">September 17: Building an Enterprise Architecture with Patterns (Recap Session)</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The previous sessions focused on high-level patterns for building effective enterprise architectures. This webinar examines the good, the bad, and the occasionally ugly aspects of the architectural patterns, which IT professionals should be prepared to capitalize on or mitigate. Additionally, the session explores the conditions under which one architectural pattern is the preferred choice for a given scenario, as well as when a more granular approach to a common pattern may be required.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Presenting the webinar will be Mifan Careem, WSO2 director of solutions architecture.
