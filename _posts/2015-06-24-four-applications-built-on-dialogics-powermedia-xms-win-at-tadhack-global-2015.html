<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="http://www.dialogic.com/">Dialogic</a>, a global networking software and infrastructure solution provider, announces four winners that participated in the TADHack Global event. Each winner was awarded a cash prize. The event featured over 1,400 registered participants, over 800 attendees, 12 title sponsors, spanning 15 global locations, with more than 90 hacks total and $36,000 awarded in cash and prizes. &ldquo;It was an intense experience for everyone involved. Cooperation between teams was amazing -- diversity is important to winning; and the sponsors had an intense couple of days as developers hacked on their APIs and platforms,&rdquo; said Alan Quayle, TADHack founder and organizer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Dialogic was the host sponsor for the London site, which contributed seven submissions to the overall event. A global winner who built his application on Dialogic&reg; PowerMedia&trade; XMS was Eoghan &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in of Glorsoft, with his WebRTC contact center complete with call queuing and context exchanging. Winners in London who based their applications on the PowerMedia XMS platform included Phaninder Pasupula, with his SmlessConf submission that integrated XMS conferencing with a Matrix chat room; Leslie Drewery, with his MemChat submission for aiding individuals suffering from dementia; and Roderick Hodgson, with his source protector submission for anonymizing a person&rsquo;s voice for journalistic sources.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Long time Dialogic partner, Apex Communications, also participated in the event with a commercial showcase submission of its OmniVox3D Visual IVR system. A list of submissions can be found on the TADHack YouTube playlist.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;What these participants were able to accomplish in a weekend, with a platform and API that they are not familiar with is astonishing&rdquo; said Vince Puglia, Developer Advocate at Dialogic. He continued to say &ldquo;it validates the hard work we&rsquo;ve put into the PowerMedia XMS platform by making it simple for developers to get started and easily create world class media driven applications&rdquo;. The Dialogic&reg; PowerMedia&trade; XMS platform allows for traditional telecom and web developers to go beyond the typical peer-to-peer call flow by providing a rich-media processing development platform and media server to create exciting SIP, WebRTC, HD voice and video applications and value added services. Dialogic is set to  continue its sponsorship at the upcoming TADHack Chicago event in October.</p>
