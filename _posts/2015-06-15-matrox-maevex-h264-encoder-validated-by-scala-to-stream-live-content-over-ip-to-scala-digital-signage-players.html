<p><a href="http://www.matrox.com/">Matrox Graphics</a> today announced that Scala has validated <a href="http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/video_over_ip/maevex/">Matrox Maevex&trade; H.264</a> encoders to deliver Full HD 1080p60 video and audio content to its industry-leading digital signage software platforms. InfoComm 2015 attendees are invited to visit the Matrox booth 4053 where Matrox Maevex encoders will stream live video content over IP for display within Scala digital signage.</p>
<p>Maevex encoders deliver exceptional-quality video and audio at low, user-defined bit rates (100Kbps&ndash;25Mbps) over standard IP networks letting AV integrators affordably incorporate engaging live content within signage to attract more eyes to the surrounding messaging and branding. Live Maevex streams can be treated like any other content within the Scala software. The live feed can run alongside other live and/or canned content, be placed in different positions on the screen or video wall, and even scheduled it to run at specific times throughout the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of live content within signage is a growing trend,&rdquo; said Peter Cherna, chief product officer, Scala. &ldquo;Validation of Matrox Maevex gives our customers an affordable way to add high quality video, yet at low bitrates, and we are excited to see the variety of innovative projects that will result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Matrox and Scala digital signage combination can be used to engage audiences across a wide range of venues including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live sports feeds within menu boards, lounge video walls, and entertainment screens in bars and restaurants&nbsp;</li>
<li>CEO speeches and other corporate communications within signage in lobbies, boardrooms and cafeterias&nbsp;</li>
<li>Campus sporting events where existing webcast camera feed is streamed live to campus-wide digital signage&nbsp;</li>
<li>Local news feeds next to hotel information on screen at the check-in desk, in the hotel lobby, and in other common areas</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&ldquo;Scala&rsquo;s validation of our Matrox Maevex H.264 encoders will give signage integrators the confidence to add live video feeds to the ever-expanding variety of digital signage projects they encounter,&rdquo; said Ron Berty, business development manager, Matrox Graphics Inc. &ldquo;The Scala platforms make it easy to control live video as just another element in signage displays.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Matrox Maevex H.264 encoders and decoders deliver exceptional quality AV streaming at low bandwidth over standard IP networks for display or for storage anywhere on the LAN. Maevex encoders, priced at only $999 US (MSRP), can be combined with Maevex decoders or a third-party software decoder to stream up to Full HD digital signage, education and training materials, camera footage, desktop screen capture and other AV content to one or more displays and to collaborative video walls. Maevex encoders can also be used to record live AV content to network-attached storage (NAS) or network-shared drives at resolutions up to 1080p60. The zero-latency pass through allows realtime monitoring or connection of another device to stream at the same time as recording. Maevex units come bundled with Matrox PowerStream&trade; software, allowing for easy remote device management, stream switching and streaming/recording parameter adjustment, including user-definable bitrates between 100Kbps and 25Mbps. An API is also available for software developers who want to add Maevex device control to third-party applications.</p>
