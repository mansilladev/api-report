<p>Network Redux is pleased to announce a new service called&nbsp;<span><a href="/admin/news/seastar.io">Seastar</a></span><span>, which will provide a complete data platform for running&nbsp;</span><span>Apache Cassandra</span><span>. Seastar is built on Redux's world-class infrastructure, and is managed and supported by our experienced team of engineers.</span></p>
<p>As Chief Data Scientist Joshua Galbraith explains, "We have been helping clients manage database servers and search platforms for over a decade. By offering a better abstraction in the form of a data platform, we enable customers to focus on their applications and data instead of on building and maintaining systems."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Seastar is built on dedicated, performance-tuned hardware using low-overhead container technology and the fastest solid state storage.  Performance will exceed what's achievable on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other public cloud hosting providers for the same cost.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With Seastar, customers can have a new Cassandra cluster up and running in minutes. The web dashboard and APIs make the provisioning process simple, so clients can spend time doing more important things, like modeling and analyzing their data.</p>
