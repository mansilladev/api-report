<p><a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear Software</a>, the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, has named Tony Tam, creator of the Swagger Specification, VP of Products, Swagger. Tony has been the driving force behind Swagger, the leading API description format used by developers in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment to design and deliver APIs that fuel IoT, microservices and mobile applications. SmartBear acquired the Swagger API open source project earlier this year.<br /><br />&ldquo;Tony Tam brings his unique vision for Swagger and his passion for the API industry to SmartBear, which will help the company bring forward not only our open source strategy but our API tools strategy as a whole,&rdquo; said Doug McNary, CEO of SmartBear. &ldquo;He is a well-respected expert in the API industry, and we're excited to have Tony's knowledge and enthusiasm on the SmartBear team. The combination of Tony Tam and Ole Lensmar, creator of SoapUI, gives SmartBear a true brain trust in the space of open source API tools.&rdquo;<br /><br />During the development of Swagger, Tony served as the founder and CEO of Reverb, where he led development efforts of the site's innovative word navigation system. Swagger was created in response to a need his development team expressed for a better way to describe REST APIs. After making Swagger open source, Tony was the guiding force that moved the specification forward and created a vibrant enthusiastic community around it.
