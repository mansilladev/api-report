<li><strong>Whirlpool&reg; HybridCare&trade; Heat Pump Dryer: Outdoor venting not required.<br /></strong>The HybridCare&trade; Heat Pump Dryer is an award-winning innovation with true ventless Heat Pump dryer technology that solves key challenges in the dryer category &ndash; energy usage, gentle care for specialty clothing and identifying an appropriate space to vent outside. &nbsp;Compared to typical dryers that use large amounts of energy in the form of venting hot, moist air, this large 7.3 cu. ft. capacity dryer regenerates energy during the drying cycle using a refrigeration system to dry and recycle the same air. This process uses up to 73 percent less energy<span>i</span>&nbsp;with the Eco Dry setting while also drying loads within normal dry times, averaging 60 minutes depending on the selected cycle. The ventless design means the dryer easily installs in more places, a great solution for urban living, rentals and older homes. HybridCare&trade; technology also uses advanced sensors to manage drying temperature. Low heat allows for gentle drying of hard-to-care-for items, to give favorite clothes the best care possible.<span>ii</span>&nbsp;The HybridCare&trade; Heat Pump Dryer was also awarded Best Dryer Feature in Reviewed.com's 2014 Best of Year Washer and Dryer Awards.</li>

<li><strong>Whirlpool&reg;</strong><strong>&nbsp;Front Load Washer and Dryer with Nest Technology connects to families' needs, whether they are at home or away.<br /></strong>In working with the Nest team, Whirlpool brand has created a home experience that is both purposeful and thoughtful, starting with this laundry pair. The 'Works with Nest' laundry pair uses the Nest API (Application Programming Interface) to help save consumers energy and keeps their laundry fresh if the cycle ends while they are away.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Whirlpool&reg;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Smart Top Load Washer and Dryer<br /></strong>This laundry pair uses connected technology to not only better care for clothes, but enable families to help other families in need, load for load. Every new feature of the top load laundry pair is intentionally built to enhance the consumer's experience. New custom cycles will rollout throughout 2015. Anticipated cycles including comforters, athletic wear, swimwear and towels offer better fabric care<span>iii</span>&nbsp;and help extend the life of families' favorite items. Helping other families is now automatic through the new the Connect to care&trade; program within the Whirlpool&reg; Mobile app. This feature allows consumers to opt in and automatically make a donation to Habitat for Humanity every time they do a load of laundry, literally transforming a simple chore into an act of love. The Smart Top Load pair builds on the 'Works with Nest' platform<em>, &nbsp;</em>providing automated home and away controls to help prevent wrinkles, delay cycles when energy costs are high, and activate quiet mode, all within the Whirlpool&reg; Mobile app.</li>
