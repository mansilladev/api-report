<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Windows File Server Integration:&nbsp;Now, organizations using Windows File Servers can securely access and collaborate on files natively within Incentive. Designed with Microsoft architecture in mind, Incentive leverages software in use by billions of customers and organizations across the world. Windows File Server has about&nbsp;75 percent market share&nbsp;for x86 server operating systems. With one-click integration, companies that have a complex network structure or require strict security standards can easily search for, access, discuss, share, comment, like and collaborate on local files, as well as get updates in the Incentive News Feed whenever local files are edited.</li>
<li>Closed Spaces:&nbsp;With new private areas for collaboration, teams and departments can keep conversations, documents and other information private and accessible only by members.</li>
<li>Polls:&nbsp;This new feature gives users an easy way to pose questions and collect responses from colleagues, fostering teamwork and knowledge sharing.</li>
<li>Autosave:&nbsp;Now documents are continuously saved as users are editing to ensure no work is lost and make document collaboration more efficient.</li>
<li>Enhanced User Experience:&nbsp;With new layouts for its member and group directories and the ability to change colors and add a company&rsquo;s logo, enterprises can customize Incentive however they want. A new, easy-to-use drag and drop feature also makes working with documents more efficient by enabling users to drag images right into the editor of a document without needing to upload them first.</li>
<li>Strengthened Search Function:&nbsp;Incentive&rsquo;s smart search engine now provides sharper relevancy and prioritization of items to help employees quickly discover information they need to work more efficiently.</li>
<li>Web Notifications:&nbsp;Users can now receive notifications directly in their web browser for real-time updates.</li>
</ul>
