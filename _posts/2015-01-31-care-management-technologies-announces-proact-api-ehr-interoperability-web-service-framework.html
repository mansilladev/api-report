<p><a href="http://cmthealthcare.com/">Care Management Technologies (CMT)</a>, a population health data analytics company that specializes in behavioral health announces the<em>ProAct</em>&nbsp;Application Programming Interface (API) for Electronic Health Records (EHR). CMT will offer its clinical decision support tools including risk predictive, care directive and evidence-based algorithms directly at the point of care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CMT's&nbsp;<em>ProAct</em>&nbsp;API allows web service access to our healthcare data platform. &nbsp;Healthcare software vendors can integrate our analytics into their existing EHR or other application. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>ProAct</em>&nbsp;API provides access via a diverse set of GET/POST calls using simple, scalable REST search functions. The data is returned in a variety of industry standard data formats including XML and JSON, all selectable by the caller&rdquo; according to Jon Kennerly, Chief Software Architect at CMT.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>ProAct</em>&nbsp;API framework has adopted best practice architecture using message-based design. &nbsp;This allows for easy extension to new data sources, flexibility, and versioning. &nbsp;New CMT analytics endpoints are being added regularly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ability to deploy&nbsp;<em>ProAct&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;clinical decision support analytics across all providers regardless of EHR or other electronic platform supports the integration of behavioral and primary care analytics at the point of care.&nbsp; This technology extends the ability of payers and providers to promote evidence-based care at the population and individual consumer level, an essential component for improving the quality of health and healthcare in any value based delivery of care models.&nbsp; "Hats off to the CMT technology and product team for their advancements of a technological capability that ultimately saves lives,&rdquo; added Carol Clayton, PhD, CEO at CMT.</p>
