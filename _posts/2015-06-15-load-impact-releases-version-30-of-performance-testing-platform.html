<p><a href="https://loadimpact.com/">Load Impact</a>, the most popular cloud-based load and performance testing software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for web, mobile and APIs, announced Load Impact Version 3.0 today.</p>
<p>Load Impact Version 3.0 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Trending -</strong> Allows users to plot runs of the same test over time in order to locate patterns of performance degradation or improvement and more easily validate the performance impact of code and infrastructure changes</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Data Stores - </strong>Allows users to more accurately and easily simulate reality by including several different sources of parameterized data in their test scripts</li>
<li><strong>Sleek new user interface (UI) -</strong> Designed to simplify the process of configuring, running and analyzing test results</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Performance Trending feature, Load Impact 3.0 significantly improves the user&rsquo;s ability to gain both a low-level and high-level view into the performance of their systems.</p>
<p>Individual test run results provide granular data for analysis, such as requests per second for individual requests, time-to-first-byte (latency) and connection-time, while Performance Trending allows the user to plot a single, high-level performance metric collected during multiple test runs in the same graph.</p>
<p>"Right now, Load Impact is great for detecting and identifying performance problems, but we&rsquo;d also like it to be a great tool for working long-term with performance and knowing if your code performs better today than it did last month, for instance," said Ragnar L&ouml;nn, founder and Lead Ops Engineer of Load Impact.</p>
<p>"The modern DevOps team wants to stay on top of performance, and know that their codebase or their automated infrastructure doesn&rsquo;t regress, and regular load tests combined with performance trending is a good way of achieving this."</p>
<p>Load Impact 3.0 seeks to make it easy for developers, DevOps teams and even management, to track performance trends in a quick and comprehensible way; and help teams quantify performance changes so they can easily justify performance work when planning sprints.</p>
<p>Load Impact 3.0 also comes with its own Performance Testing Methodology. Load Impact&rsquo;s Professional Services team, who have a combined 20+ years experience in Quality Assurance (QA) testing and software development, have put their years of experience to paper and formulated a seven-part methodology to achieving performance testing success. Customized methodologies for E-commerce, Media and Software platforms are also available.</p>
<p>All Load Impact users will be automatically given access to Version 3.0 on June 15th, 2015.</p>
