As traditional Virtual Assistants (VAs) and Virtual Customer Assistants (VCAs) aim to answer basic questions and perform simple tasks, SARA will revolutionize the interaction by integrating with sophisticated back office systems and deeper understanding of complex problem resolution.</p>
<p>Cisco has a vision, which is a significant shift from the traditional support and services paradigm: Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make use of the data stored in networking devices such as routers, increase speed to resolution, make real time updates, and perform tasks for network administrators. In a simplified explanation, a scenario might include a user with a problem in the datacenter. The Virtual Assistant can, for example, capture data from a sophisticated router, and after troubleshooting, pass that information to an administrator for faster case resolution. In addition, this scenario can be expanded to make use of other Cisco APIs to streamline processes while making support less cumbersome.</p>
<p>noHold began working with Cisco and its powerful onePK Application Programming Interface (API) earlier in 2014, to demonstrate that this vision will be reality in the near future. The brands have successfully proven that this type of Virtual Assistant can troubleshoot and diagnose complex issues, &lsquo;talk' to the device, make updates, and more. onePK is an element within Cisco's Open Network Environment software-defined networking (SDN) strategy. onePK is an easy-to-use toolkit for development, automation, rapid service creation, and more. With its rich set of APIs, you can easily access the valuable data inside your network.</p>
<p>According to Diego Ventura, noHold's CEO and Founder, the end goal was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of connecting a Virtual Assistant with Cisco's back end systems. &ldquo;Overall, we wanted to create an experience that mirrors Cisco's vision and create a Virtual support partner that can help. In the technology space, the level of complexity is increasing; in the datacenter, it's even more complex. We wanted to prove to ourselves that we can use machines to fight the very complexity that they [machines and technology] have created. Cisco has a very sophisticated set of APIs that can be leveraged by third party vendors and partners. On our side, we were excited to see that the Virtual Assistant can not only query, but can control information in the database, the devices themselves, while being able to leverage the context of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glenn Schleicher, Sr. Director/GM of Cisco's Smart Web Technology Group explains that &ldquo;as our partners and customers seek low touch, low effort ways to operate and manage increasingly complex networks, traditional technologies such as knowledge base search fail to deliver.&nbsp;Virtual agent technologies have come a long way, and we were pleased to partner with noHold to explore what is possible today.&nbsp;The potential to streamline and automate complex customer service interactions is huge.&rdquo;</p>
