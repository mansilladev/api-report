<p><a href="http://www.livefyre.com">Livefyre</a>, the leading real-time content marketing and engagement platform, today announced it is among the first Twitter Official Partners to access Twitter&rsquo;s Full-Archive Search API in two categories: Displaying Content Publicly and Discovering Content for News.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">More details:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> This marks the first time in Twitter&rsquo;s history that brands and publishers will have real-time access to the platform&rsquo;s entire historical database in order to find and display Twitter content on their owned and operated properties. Livefyre customers will have unprecedented access to this new data and functionality. </li>
<li> The Twitter Full-Archive Search API increases the archive of searchable Twitter content from 30 days to nearly 10 years, meaning Livefyre customers can track relationships, timelines and events in ways that were previously impossible.</li>
<li> Brands and publishers can now extend the lifespan of valuable user-generated content indefinitely, access ongoing conversations instead of just recent samples, capture previously untracked streams of content, and discover long-term trends and conversations.</li>
<li> Livefyre was also a launch partner for the Twitter Official Partner Program in June 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This is a historical moment for publishers and brands everywhere,&rdquo; said Livefyre founder and CEO Jordan Kretchmer. &ldquo;Livefyre customers now have the entire history of Twitter at their fingertips. It&rsquo;s going to have a profound impact on what brands and publishers can do with user-generated content.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Livefyre is the most scalable social depth platform in the industry and was recently named a leader in an independent report from Forrester, &ldquo;The Forrester Wave&trade;: Social Depth Platforms, Q2 2015.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s news comes on the heels of yet another historic achievement for Livefyre: the platform served a record-breaking 900,000 concurrent live users with zero latency during last week&rsquo;s primetime Republican Presidential Primary Debate, more than tripling the previous record. This is expected to increase even further as Livefyre's customer base continues to expand and online properties draw bigger audiences throughout the election season.</p>
