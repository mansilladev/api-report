By providing the complete set of API calls required to program the integration within the Cloudwords sandbox, developers are able to quickly build and test Cloudwords integrations with any content system their business users rely on, further simplifying the process of moving content in and out of critical content systems for localization and speeding time-to-market to reach and engage multilingual audiences.</p>
