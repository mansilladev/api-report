<p class="responsiveNews">John G Kuruvilla, Managing Director, Specialty Hospitals Group, Pvt.

A world class cutting edge solution like BlueEHS-HITaaS will not only help RIMS but also elevate the level of technology in the state, consequently helping both patients and doctors.&ldquo;</p>

The demand for BlueEHS is on the rise, monthly sign-ups from doctors and practices are 400 and growing.

BlueEHS-HITaaS makes Healthcare IT easy and affordable which in turn will bring high-end healthcare technology to people all over the globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Healthcare is an area where technology can bring lifesaving impact and governments globally recognize the need to better utilize technology to improve their healthcare systems. At the same time, health information technology is highly specialized within expertise, and compliance and regulatory frameworks must be followed. Thus, health IT can be intricate, complex, and costly requiring significant time and resources to develop a solution that properly accounts for all constituents.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Health IT innovators can use BlueEHS-HITaaS to address these many challenges. They need not reinvent tools to get their project off the ground, instead they can reconfigure the modules from ZH&rsquo;s library which continues to grow both from ZH and users. Also, ZH already has agreements with laboratories, electronic prescription networks, clearinghouses, health information exchanges, and other entities that form a health information network, developing this network from scratch could take years.  Further, the solution is delivered on a cloud based regulatory compliant platform.  Finally, having configured the solution a health IT innovator can white label and commercialize their solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ZH Healthcare Partners from across the world have leveraged the platform to develop various solutions, examples include: a fully Arabic and regionalized platform for the Middle East, an EHR exclusively for the sleep study market, a health IT solution for the long-term care industry, a chronic care management patient engagement tool, and a video consultation application.  Key among these is an EHR for outpatient clinics that is highly customizable with configurable treatment plans and clinical processes.</p>
