<p>"The exponential growth and expansion of the Internet of Things, the advent of &ldquo;smart everything,&rdquo; and the intersection of open source and open standards are creating new and exciting opportunities fueled by the cross-pollination of applications and services that previously existed in their own confines,&rdquo; said Oleg Logvinov, chair, IEEE Internet Initiative and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstandards.ieee.org%2Fdevelop%2Fproject%2F2413.html&amp;esheet=51070686&amp;newsitemid=20150401005217&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=IEEE+P2413TM&amp;index=3&amp;md5=b6c38f10576a1e931d0765f17cc8a84e" target="_blank">IEEE P2413TM</a>&nbsp;working group; director, special assignments, Industrial and Power Conversion Division, STMicroelectronics.&nbsp;&ldquo;At the same time, it is important to address vulnerabilities that could be created in the process. IEEE will be contributing to meaningful dialog at RSA on the future of API regulation and development, human/technology relationships, IoT security, and more. By convening global experts, IEEE will help lead important discussions, drive collaboration, and contribute to technologies and practices that will better serve humanity."</p>
<p>IEEE&rsquo;s outreach at RSA is a natural extension of its open, global, collaborative work in cybersecurity in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">The IEEE Internet Initiative, launched in 2015 dedicates efforts to amplifying the voice of the technical community in the global technology policy-making process to inform and influence debate and decisions and to help ensure trustworthy technology solutions and best practices.</li>
