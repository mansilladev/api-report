<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHB5cGllLmNvbS8=">App Maker Appy Pie</a>&nbsp;launches API for In-App Purchasing (IAP) that will allow its users sell digital content and subscriptions for magazines, music albums, videos and more from within their apps. The good part is that the application does not have to directly process any financial transactions. When in-app billing service is used, Google Play &amp; iTunes handles all the checkout details. The checkout service used at the backend is the same that is used for application purchases. This provides users with a familiar purchase flow.</p>
<p>As more and more experiences move into the mobile environment, the way customers interact with and pay for services is being transformed. This newly launched API uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) to represent the items that can be purchased and ensures easy integration, fast checkout &amp; secure payments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Developers now have the ability to create an even deeper connection between their app and the products customer&rsquo;s value and purchase through their App,&rdquo; said Abhinav Girdhar, Founder Appy Pie. &ldquo;Imagine a developer of a nutrition and fitness app can now offer their customers the ability to purchase workout programme available as an E-book or Video. It offers the customer a more relevant experience and provides the developer with a new source of revenue.&rdquo;</p>
