<p><a href="http://buildup.vc/">BUILDUP</a>,&nbsp;a U.S. based 501(c)(3) non-profit designed to connect, mentor and educate technology entrepreneurs, today announced it is working with several leading edge tech companies to deliver a six-part technical workshop series. The BUILDUP Technical Workshop Series will feature leaders from Google, TechCrunch, Uber, Twitter and Galvanize coaching attendees on pitching a startup, cyber security, building a minimum viable product (MVP), application program interfaces (APIs) and more.</p>
<p>Designed to educate and prepare individuals from underrepresented groups for career paths in technology, the BUILDUP Technical Workshop Series will take place over five weeks beginning May 26th.</p>
<p>The current workforce for Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area tech companies reflects staggeringly low representation of employees across gender and racial categories in contrast to the diverse population of the world. Recent statistics show the average tech workforce demographics from top Silicon Valley tech companies include 2% Blacks, 1% Latino and 20% women.</p>
<p>"Lack of access to technical coaching and education have prevented individuals from diverse backgrounds from pursuing opportunities in technology,&rdquo; said Wayne Sutton, general partner of BUILDUP. &ldquo;With tech leaders working with programs like BUILDUP and the workshop series, we&rsquo;re delivering entry level technical training and entrepreneurship programs that target these groups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workshop series co-led by Google, TechCrunch, Uber, Twitter and Galvanize is targeted at individuals considering new careers in tech, launching a startup or building a product, or interested in attending a code school. The series is also geared toward junior engineers, developers and designers, college students, or entrepreneurs looking to sharpen their current tech skill set.  The workshop series will be promoted through <a href="http://buildup.vc/connect/">BUILDUP&rsquo;s connect network</a>.</p>
<p>The series kicks off a partnership between BUILDUP and Galvanize, a San Francisco-based educational company and startup hub, which will host BUILDUP&rsquo;s pre-accelerator program beginning this fall at the firm&rsquo;s new headquarters.</p>
<p>Workshops are $30 for each class and will take place at Galvanize, 44 Tehama Street in San Francisco.</p>

<p>BUILDUP was founded in 2014 by Wayne Sutton, Kristina Omari and Christian Anderson, who together have more than 30 years experience in technology and investing. Sutton is a three-time startup founder and co-founder of the first minority lead startup accelerator/incubator in Silicon Valley, while both Omari and Anderson bring a wealth of knowledge from their backgrounds in technology, strategy, investments and business development. Together, they formed BUILDUP as they noted the extreme lack of minority technology role models, such as founders or investors who are women, African-American, or Hispanic for upcoming entrepreneurs to approach as mentors or advisors.</p>
<p>The firm is dedicated to increasing innovation globally by bringing innovators together from an array of backgrounds and experience &ndash; from the technology, education, health, design, environmental, social and political sectors. BUILDUP hosts educational events featuring successful founders, designers, investors and thought leaders to assist in providing valuable information to first time and experienced entrepreneurs.</p>
