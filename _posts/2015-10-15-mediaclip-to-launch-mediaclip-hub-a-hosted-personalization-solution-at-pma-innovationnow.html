<p><a href="http://www.mediaclip.ca/">Mediaclip</a>, the premier developer of white-label product-personalization software, will launch their new hosted solution during the PMA Innovation Now Photo Business and Technology Summit, Sept. 27-28th in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Mediaclip Hub is a whole new way to add personalization functionality to any e-commerce platform. This new hosted solution provides an easy way for retailers, e-commerce providers, manufacturers and content providers to offer the proven Mediaclip Designer user experience to their customers. The solution accelerates time to market, reduces integration and updating costs, while retaining merchandising flexibility.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Mediaclip Hub uses a SaaS approach to isolate away most of the complexity, and also comes bundled with expected core functionality like photo upload and hosting single sign on for users and projects. More advanced features - sharing and social network integration - are planned to be released early 2016. Customers can now easily integrate with the e-commerce solution of their choice, using a set of simple REST APIs. This means that a personalization website can be up and running within a few days. Mediaclip Hub also comes with a nopCommerce plugin to shorten the integration time even further.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Over the years we realized how crucial it was for our customers to be able to control their merchandizing to increase their consumer base and revenue,&rdquo; says Marion Duchesne, CEO, Mediaclip. &ldquo;With Mediaclip Hub, we are removing the technological burden by managing the solution components for our clients so they can focus on their consumers&rsquo; needs and preferences. A lot of good open source e-commerce platforms already exist and provide a great online shopping experience. This is why it is important for us to provide our customers with the flexibility to use their own platform or to choose the one allowing them to achieve their business goals in respect to their marketing strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Since customization of the user interface happens outside of Mediaclip Hub rather than within the hosted API, updating becomes painless,&rdquo; says Christian Rondeau, CIO, Mediaclip. &ldquo;Most importantly, our customers benefit right away from new features and innovations since we are handling the software updates directly on our end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Both Duschene and Rondeau will be speaking at PMA InnovationNow. Duschene, who founded the company in 2005, will be a panelist at the "Telling It Like It Is" session, Sunday, Sept. 27th, at 4:15 p.m. The session features leading photo entrepreneurs sharing their success, their challenges, their secrets and their visions. Rondeau will be a panelist at the "Making It Happen" session, Monday, Sept. 28th, at 2:15 p.m. The session will cover how various companies are investing in the next generation of technologies defining tomorrow&rsquo;s commercial and consumer photo experiences.</p>
