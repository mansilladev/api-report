<p>SafeRTOS CORE incorporates key safety features such as MPU/MMU support for Task isolation, combined with functionality that has a proven, successful history of use within Embedded Safety Critical Applications all over the world. It is the solution WHIS offer in response to the strong market demand for a robust &amp; highly deterministic RTOS for embedded designs, where safety needs to be considered, without certification.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SafeRTOS CORE uses the actual core SafeRTOS design, source code and API that is common across all safety certified SafeRTOS variants, ported for use on a specific processor/compiler combination. Whereas SafeRTOS is supplied with a Design Assurance Pack (for Industrial Devices) supporting certification to IEC 61508 SIL 3, or a Design History File (for Medical Devices) supporting certification to EN62304/FDA510(k) Class C, SafeRTOS CORE is supplied as source code accompanied by a comprehensive User Manual and an &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; working demonstration application.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">WHIS has already secured multiple lead customers for SafeRTOS CORE within the Medical and Industrial markets.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;SafeRTOS has a long and successful history of use within embedded safety critical applications requiring certification to the highest levels possible,&rdquo; said Andrew Longhurst, Business Development Manager for WITTENSTEIN high integrity systems. &ldquo;SafeRTOS CORE provides this pedigree and safety critical functionality to engineers developing embedded systems that need to consider safety, but don&rsquo;t require full certification, or for embedded safety systems that may not require certification documentation support early in their development life cycles.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For applications that may not require certification/documentation at the start of a long safety development life cycle, there is an easy upgrade route from SafeRTOS CORE to full SafeRTOS that can be taken at any time during the product development process.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SafeRTOS CORE is available ported for use on a specific Processor/Compiler combination. It is available fully integrated with advanced, feature-rich Middleware and Safety Components, provided by WHIS as one seamless build of code.</p>
