<p>I'm really late this week, because of busy week in Colorado, at Gluecon. I finally got it done, and since this process is more about my learning than getting out an on-time report, I'm going to forgive myself. ;-)</p>
<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
