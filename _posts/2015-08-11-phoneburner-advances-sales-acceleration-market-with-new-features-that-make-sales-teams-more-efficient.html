And they don&rsquo;t want to jump through hoops to integrate new sales tools into their current systems. PhoneBurner earns our customers&rsquo; business every month by giving them completely customizable CRM tools for increased sales productivity and contact rates. It&rsquo;s the way SaaS is supposed to be.&rdquo;</p>
