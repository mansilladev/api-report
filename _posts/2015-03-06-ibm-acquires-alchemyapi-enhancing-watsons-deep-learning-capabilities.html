<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM</a> (NYSE:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibm.com/investor/" target="_blank">IBM</a>) today announced it has acquired&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/" target="_blank">AlchemyAPI</a>, a leading provider of scalable&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/index.shtml#fbid=G_LXXsxYBRM" target="_blank">cognitive computing</a>&nbsp;application program interface (API) services and deep learning technology. The acquisition will accelerate IBM's development of next generation cognitive computing applications.</p>
<p>The acquisition also significantly expands the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/ecosystem.html" target="_blank">Watson ecosystem</a>, welcoming 40,000 developers that have innovated on the AlchemyAPI platform to&nbsp;the IBM Watson developer community. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>IBM will integrate AlchemyAPI's deep learning technology into the core&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/" target="_blank">Watson</a>&nbsp;platform, augmenting&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson's</span>&nbsp;ability to quickly identify hierarchies and understand relationships within large volume data sets. The technology is expected to enhance&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson's</span>&nbsp;ability to ingest, train and learn the "long-tail" of various data domains &ndash; including general business and target industries, as well as address the need to manage constantly evolving ontologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the acquisition will greatly expand the number and types of scalable cognitive computing APIs available to IBM clients, developers, partners and other members of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;ecosystem. This includes language analysis APIs to address new types of text and visual recognition, and the ability to automatically detect, label and extract important details from image data.</p>
<p>Founded in 2005 and headquartered in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Denver</span>, AlchemyAPI's deep learning platform enables clients, partners, developers and other third-parties to build cognitive-infused applications with advanced data analysis capabilities such as taxonomy categorization, entity and keyword extraction, sentiment analysis and web page cleaning. The company's software platform processes billions of API calls per month across 36 countries and in eight different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.</p>
<p>"IBM continues to invest in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson's</span>&nbsp;core technology and cloud development platform, amplifying a robust&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;ecosystem where third party organizations are creating new businesses and solutions powered by&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Mike Rhodin</span>, senior vice president, IBM Watson. "Our ability to draw upon both internal and external sources of innovation, from IBM Research to acquisitions like AlchemyAPI, remain central to our strategy of bringing&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;to new markets, industries and regions."</p>
<p>"Today is the start of a new journey for AlchemyAPI, our customers and our user community, as we join IBM, the leader in cognitive computing," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Elliot Turner</span>, founder and CEO, AlchemyAPI. "We founded AlchemyAPI with the mission of democratizing deep learning artificial intelligence for real-time analysis of unstructured data and giving the world's developers access to these capabilities to innovate. As part of IBM's&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;unit, we have an infinite opportunity to further that goal."</p>
<p><span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/marketplace.html" target="_blank">cloud</a>, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers.&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions.</p>
<p>IBM is delivering new&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;services and APIs through the Watson Zone on&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/" target="_blank">Bluemix</a>, the company's digital innovation platform that enables developers to rapidly build, deploy and manage apps across any combination of public, private and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/cloud-solutions/it-service-management/hybrid-cloud-application-management.html" target="_blank">hybrid cloud</a>. Thousands of developers, entrepreneurs, data hobbyists, students and others have already built more than 7,000 apps powered by&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;to date.</p>
<p>AlchemyAPI's capabilities, including new language analysis and visual recognition services, will be delivered through Bluemix, and enable developers to quickly build a range of business applications. New and existing users can sign up for a free trial and access the AlchemyAPI services today on&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bluemix.net/" target="_blank">www.bluemix.net</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today's news builds on the recent announcement of IBM Watson Personality Insights API and the launch of five&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/02/04/new-watson-services-available/" target="_blank">new beta Watson Services</a>, bringing the total number of cognitive API services to thirteen in the past six months alone.</p>
<p><strong>IBM Watson: Pioneering a New Era of Computing</strong></p>
<p>IBM Watson enhances, scales and accelerates human expertise, and represents a new era of computing in which apps and systems interact with human users more naturally, augment knowledge with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ibm.com/big-data/us/en/big-data-and-analytics/" target="_blank">Big Data</a>&nbsp;insights, and learn and improve over time.</p>
<p>Fueled by innovation and a mission to transform industries and professions, IBM is delivering a range of cloud-based products and services to clients in industries such as banking, healthcare, insurance, retail and education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">January 2014</span>, IBM launched the IBM Watson unit, a business dedicated to developing and commercializing cloud-delivered cognitive computing technologies. The move signified a strategic shift by IBM to deliver a new class of software, services and apps that think, improve by learning, and discover insights from massive amounts of Big Data. IBM is investing&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1 billion</span>&nbsp;into the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>&nbsp;unit, focusing on development and research, and bringing cloud-delivered cognitive applications and services to market. This includes&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$100 million</span>&nbsp;available for venture investments that support IBM's ecosystem of start-ups and businesses building cognitive apps powered by<span class="xn-location">Watson</span>.</p>
