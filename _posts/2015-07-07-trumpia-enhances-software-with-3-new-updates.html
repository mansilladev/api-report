<p><a href="http://www.trumpia.com">Trumpia</a>, the leading mobile messaging and cross-channel marketing automation software provider, today released 3 new updates.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The first update allows users to send appointment reminders through any business phone number as well as a short code. Users can now send appointment reminders through text, email, mobile app, and voice broadcasts, letting them cater to their customers&rsquo; channel preferences.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The second update is called Text-to-Speech. It enables users to type a message that gets converted into a synthesized voice broadcast by Trumpia&rsquo;s software. This is a great option for users who don&rsquo;t have the means, or simply don&rsquo;t want to record their message.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Lastly, in efforts to strengthen their security, Trumpia introduced new requirements for account passwords. Moving forward, all passwords are required to have 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase letter, one number or special character, and cannot be a simple word from the dictionary. Also, accounts will only allow a certain number of login attempts with incorrect passwords.</p>
