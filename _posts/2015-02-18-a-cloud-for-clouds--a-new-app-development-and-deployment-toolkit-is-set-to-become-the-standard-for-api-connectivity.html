<p>Most developers today want to focus on the final experience, not building a software development and deployment platform for each application feature repeatedly. Nobody enjoys reinventing the wheel. Fortunately, software components are becoming more and more modular in nature due to the exponential growth of cloud-powered API markets. For example, if a developer wants to build maps or accept credit card payments in their product, they don&rsquo;t have to rebuild each processing stack.</p>
<p>Currently, developers have to solve inevitable problems when designing application back-end solutions such as secured user authentication, data encryption/decryption, platform-independent message communication, multimedia processing, and more. It takes a highly-skilled team, and potentially a few months which consumes dollars, resources, and time.</p>
<p>Amerra Connect&rsquo;s purpose is to simplify the process of adding connective capabilities to apps for integrating different cloud services and pre-build software components, while also eliminating concerns surrounding server-side solutions and managed scalability.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amerraconnect.com/">Amerra Connect&nbsp;platform</a> is the foundation that allows developers to build cloud-powered applications using a flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model by monitoring API calls and data transactions.</p>
<p>The original idea started a couple years ago when there became a need for custom content delivery vehicles to reach more customers. "This platform became an intuitive solution not only for Amerra, but something we felt could be widely utilized throughout the software development community waiting for one unified cloud software platform", says Amerra's Chief Technology Officer, Yong woon Ahn.</p>
<p>Amerra plans to offer various incentives for app developers to stay on the newly released platform, even as they grow.It is currently free during their Alpha release and will then implement small transaction fees for API calls and data. As different app developers, industries, and business leaders become more inclined to adopt the technology, user demand could help facilitate widespread use of this cost-efficient and reliable methodology.</p>
<p>The Alpha version of Amerra Connect's SDK is available directly from the website,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amerraconnect.com/">http://www.amerraconnect.com</a>, and is being launched on KickStarter,&nbsp;</p>
