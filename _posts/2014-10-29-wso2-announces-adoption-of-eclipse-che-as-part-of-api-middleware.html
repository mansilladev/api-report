<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1pkfMDg"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://api.report/images/kinlane/wso2-logo-white-400X180.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a><a href="http://bit.ly/1pkfMDg">WSO2</a> has announced that it will adopt Eclipse Che as the core platform for all WSO2 tooling supporting its middleware, cloud, and mobile platforms. <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20141027_cloud_initiative.php">Che, introduced by the Eclipse Foundation</a>, is an open source platform for software-as-a-service (SaaS) integrated developer environments, which uniquely offers the ability for software vendors to create custom cloud developer tools that are fast, secure and extensible. Through Che, WSO2 will add rapid integrated development environment (IDE) creation, developer collaboration, and extensibility to the WSO2 platform.</p>
<p>WSO2 Developer Studio is migrating from the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) to Eclipse Che with version 4.0. WSO2 has completed the first development milestone of WSO2 Developer Studio 4.0, which will allow development of Web applications and is slated for general availability in Q1 2015. The IDE leverages a number of existing Codenvy plugins and delivers an on-premises working version of Codenvy, which can be used for development of applications based on WSO2 Application Server.</p>
<p>Current tooling based on Eclipse RCP will be maintained and supported for another three years for WSO2 customers. Like all WSO2 middleware products, WSO2 Developer Studio is a fully open source solution that does not carry any licensing fees. It is released under the Apache License 2.0 and Eclipse Public License.</p>
