<p><a href="http://web.admobilize.com/">AdMobilize&reg;</a>, an Internet of Things technology company that quantifies the physical world, has launched "<strong>AdBeacon&reg;</strong>", the world's first "Plug and Measure" analytics platform for Out of Home, digital signage advertising, and retail. A patent pending platform marries advanced object-detection software with easy to install hardware allowing operators and agencies to understand campaign performance in real time.</p>
<p>The AdBeacon, a device about the size of an iPhone 5, uses a camera sensor to collect data from physical spaces. By implementing AdBeacon technology on OOH &amp; DOOH products, metrics such as impressions, confirmed views, dwell time, peak times, and audience demographics are captured and displayed on an intuitively designed dashboard all in real time. &nbsp;For digital signage with built-in camera sensors, AdMobilize offers a seamless and comprehensive API solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The OOH advertising&nbsp;industry is struggling to find ways to have better analytics as to who and when consumers are most likely to see their ads," said Out of Home expert&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Nick Coston</span>. "OOH has been ripe for disruption for decades and it's great to see start-ups like AdMobilize bringing transparency to our business. This will take all the guesswork out of the current methods that rely heavily on historical data. AdMobilize has created a product that is visionary, revolutionary, and cost-effective. I believe that years from now this technology will be the norm for OOH measurement."</p>
<p>"AdMobilize's technology provides operators and agencies the only turnkey solution to solve the very complex physical world analytics problem. &nbsp;Our goal is to work on the really hard things, so you can focus on growing your business while benefiting from this cutting edge disruptive solution," said AdMobilize's CEO,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rodolfo Saccoman</span>.</p>
