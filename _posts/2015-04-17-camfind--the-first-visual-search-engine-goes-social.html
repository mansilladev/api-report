<p>Image Searcher, Inc. announced today that it has released a new version of&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camfind-search-qr-reader-price/id595857716?mt=8" target="_blank">CamFind for iOS</a>, the world's first successful mobile visual search engine. Not only will this update continue to improve upon CamFind's&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.mashape.com/list-of-14-image-recognition-apis/" target="_blank">industry leading image recognition</a>&nbsp;and visual search technology, but will also provide a brand new user interface allowing interaction with pictures being taken by users around the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although CamFind first made visual search available in 2013, this marks a major achievement for the industry as a whole, as for the first time visual search has become social. Users will now have the ability to not only 'search the physical world', but also&nbsp;<em>like</em>images in order to upvote them in CamFind's new 'Popular' pictures feed.&nbsp; In addition, users will be able to&nbsp;<em>favorite</em>&nbsp;images, along with the corresponding search results, to add them to their own personal list for future reference.&nbsp; A new 'Live Stream' also offers a feed of visual searches happening in real-time. CamFind will progressively increase the number of social features available over time.</p>
<p>These milestones come on the heels of CamFind officially surpassing the 2 million download mark, Image Searcher, Inc. also recently announcing a&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/24/camfind-raises-5m-and-launches-its-image-recognition-api-for-any-developer-to-use/" target="_blank">$4.8 million funding</a>&nbsp;round, and the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://thenextweb.com/creativity/2015/02/24/camfind-launches-cloudsight-api-for-multiplatform-visual-search-functionality/" target="_blank">launch of its new public API</a>, CloudSight (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cloudsightapi.com/" target="_blank">http://cloudsightapi.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"We wanted to literally and figuratively give developers the gift of 'sight,' meaning we would provide the visual search technology for their products and services,</em>" explains CamFind cofounder and CEO<span class="xn-person">Dominik Mazur</span>.&nbsp;<em>"We also want developers to use their imaginations to create new and exciting possibilities for physical devices."</em></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cloudsightapi.com/" target="_blank">CloudSight API</a>&nbsp;employs deep learning, a technology that simulates the human brain, "learning" from its mistakes over time, and is the same technology powering CamFind.&nbsp; CamFind contains a massive database of over 50 million user generated non-contrived images which are all annotated, making it the largest such database in existence.</p>
<p><em>"Using deep learning, we set up an advanced image recognition technology to give results from our servers</em>," says Mazur.&nbsp;<em>"With this, we can go deeply into identifying, say, the exact make and model of a car or breed of dog &mdash; not just a classification</em>.&nbsp;<em>What sets us apart is that we always provide an answer with a varying degree of detail. It's not just an exact answer or no answer at all."</em></p>
