<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>&nbsp;today announced it has joined the ServiceMax Marketplace to simplify the integration of CRM, Finance and Help Desk services that field service companies and technicians use on a daily basis. Customers of ServiceMax can use Cloud Elements&rsquo; pre-built integrations to easily connect their app to&nbsp;ServiceMax&nbsp;and the other cloud services they use, such as SugarCRM, Microsoft Dynamics, Netsuite, Quickbooks, FreshBooks, ServiceNow, Zendesk and many others.</p>
<p>Often data is stored in several systems of record, such as CRM, Finance and Help Desk systems, causing duplication of data and additional time spent on data entry. Cloud Elements&rsquo; integrations allow these systems to work together seamlessly and eliminate extra work for technicians. Using Cloud Elements, field service companies and technicians will be able to access and sync data, such as contacts, accounts, products, invoices and tickets, in real time across all of the cloud services they use. Integrations between ServiceMax and popular cloud services will be available in the ServiceMax Marketplace via Cloud Elements&rsquo; services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloud Elements is excited to be a part of the ServiceMax Marketplace, as we offer the ability to integrate entire categories of services through pre-built integrations to help ServiceMax users get the most out of their applications,&rdquo; said Mark Geene, CEO of Cloud Elements. &ldquo;We create a cooperative experience for ServiceMax users, so sharing and accessing real time data in ServiceMax is simpler than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As organizations increasingly turn to technology to deliver flawless field service and empower their employees to turn customers into raving fans, it couldn&rsquo;t be a better time to aggregate the most promising solutions in a single marketplace,&rdquo; said Dave Yarnold, CEO of ServiceMax. &ldquo;The 34 partners in the ServiceMax Marketplace are able to address the unique, needs of field service organizations, helping them to deliver better service to their customers and keep our world running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud Elements focuses on creating cooperative application experiences to allow the customer&rsquo;s app to instantly share data with other applications in the cloud, without placing an integration burden on the business or user who purchased the app. Customers can use a drag-and-drop interface,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2Nsb3VkLWVsZW1lbnRzLmNvbS9kYXRhbWFwcGVyLw==">Datamapper</a>, to map and transform data across the cloud services they use.
