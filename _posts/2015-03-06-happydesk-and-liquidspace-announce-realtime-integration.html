<p><a href="https://www.happydesk.com/">HappyDesk</a>&nbsp;announced today its software is now integrated with LiquidSpace, using LiquidSpace's new API. Shared spaces worldwide now have the power to provide streamlined service and space management with a single calendar as well as sync live inventory in real-time between both enterprise platforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The integration between&nbsp;HappyDesk&nbsp;and LiquidSpace is revolutionary. Shared space providers no longer have to worry about double bookings. LiquidSpace's bookings and requested amenities will now appear on HappyDesk's Master Calendar feature in real-time,&rdquo; says HappyDesk's Director of Engineering, Jo Vasev.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the launch of our API, we are thrilled to partner with HappyDesk to offer real-time integration between our platforms,&rdquo; said Doug Marinaro, President and Chief Strategy Officer of LiquidSpace. &ldquo;This integration makes it simple for properties who rely on HappyDesk software to join our fast-growing marketplace connecting people with flexible workspaces in hundreds of cities across the U.S., Canada and Australia.&rdquo;</p>
