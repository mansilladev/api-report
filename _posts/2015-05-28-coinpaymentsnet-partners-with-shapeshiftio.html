<p><a href="https://shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift.io</a>, an instant Bitcoin and altcoin exchange service, has partnered with <a href="https://www.coinpayments.net/">CoinPayments.net</a>, a cryptocurrency checkout system for merchants, through the integration of the ShapeShift API. The integration powers CoinPayment&rsquo;s platform to allow merchants to receive various cryptocurrencies and automatically trade them for their digital asset of choice.</p>
<p><em>"We are excited to offer simple and frictionless conversions to our customers using the ShapeShift API,&rdquo; said CoinPayments.net CEO Alex Alexandrov, &ldquo;This partnership gets us one step closer to a system where customer can pay in any currency they choose and vendors settle in what they find most convenient for their business."</em></p>
<p>Developed to be primarily used as an API service, ShapeShift&rsquo;s integration with CoinPayments.net is one of many partnerships the instant digital asset exchange is building. CoinPayments proved an exceptional example of how the Shapeshift API can be utilized efficiently.</p>
