<p><a href="http://www.nolimitssoftware.com/">No Limits Software</a> has added Modbus master functionality to their RaMP DCIM solution to extend building management system (BMS) capabilities to the cabinet level.</p>
<p>No Limits Software provides one of the industry&rsquo;s most comprehensive DCIM (data center infrastructure management) software solutions for managing assets, power, cooling, and energy efficiency in data centers.  &ldquo;Using a wide range of network-enabled technologies, our RaMP solution can produce a complete picture of the data center landscape, from virtual servers to servers and network equipment to the power and cooling infrastructure,&rdquo; said Dave Cole, president of No Limits Software. &rdquo;With many customers already having existing BMS systems in place, we wanted to be able to extend the capabilities of these systems to the cabinet level&rdquo;.</p>
<p>BMS systems can now use Modbus TCP to poll for cabinet level information such as total cabinet power, rack PDU power, and temperature and humidity readings. This extends the capabilities of the BMS systems to the rack level without having to purchase any additional hardware. RaMP also addresses the IT side of the data center through detailed asset management, server and VM monitoring, network management, and state of the art task and workflow management.</p>
<p>RaMP&rsquo;s ability to auto-discover both IT and facilities equipment greatly reduces the time and cost for setup as well as significantly increasing the accuracy of the data. RaMP&rsquo;s automated change management can also detect changes such as firmware and operating system upgrades, software installation, hardware modifications, and even network cable moves.</p>
<p>The RaMP solution provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Auto-discovery of detailed information for both IT and facilities equipment</li>
<li> Power and environmental monitoring down to the device level</li>
<li> Server and virtual server monitoring </li>
<li> Automated change control to reduce MTTR and increase availability</li>
<li> Web services API for integration with other systems</li>
<li> PUE, DCiE and CADE energy management calculations</li>
<li> Accurate capacity planning data to help reduce stranded power and shutdown risks</li>
<li> Device type roll-up views for an easy way to quickly compare device performance</li>
<li> Workflow and task management</li>
</ul>
