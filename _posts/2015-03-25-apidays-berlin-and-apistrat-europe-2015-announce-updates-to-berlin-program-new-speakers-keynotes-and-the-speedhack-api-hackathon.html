Two tracks cover the business and strategy of API related topics and one track focuses on topics for developers. The various sessions within the tracks include topics such as APIs &amp; Mobile, eCommerce, Enterprise &amp; Enterprise Experience and API Design.</p>
<p>A big win for the event is a keynote by Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Pascal Morgen, IT Director Germany. In &ldquo;<a title="Keynote by Coca-Colas Pascal Morgen" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2FwaWRheXNiZXJsaW4yMDE1LmFwaXN0cmF0LmNvbS9pbnRyb2R1Y2luZy1rZXlub3RlLXdoeS1hcGlzLWF0LWNvY2EtY29sYS1ieS1wYXNjYWwtbW9yZ2FuLw==">Why APIs at Coca-Cola?</a>&rdquo;, Mr. Morgen will present how Coca-Cola solved the challenge of balancing regulatory complexity with openness and transparency using APIs. Other keynote additions include Mandy Waite of Google and Lorinda Brandon of SmartBear. More details on topics and speakers can be found on the&nbsp;<a title="Event Speakers" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2FwaWRheXNiZXJsaW4yMDE1LmFwaXN0cmF0LmNvbS9zcGVha2Vycy8=">speakers</a>&nbsp;page of the event site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited to offer a final program that covers the most important aspects of API&rsquo;s&rdquo; said Mehdi Medjaoui, founder of APIDays. &ldquo;We cover strategic issues on why organisations need and use APIs, technology concerns like design best-practices, and marketing aspects including how to increase the adoption of an API provider. All in all a very well rounded program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also on the program is&nbsp;<a title="SpeedHack Berlin" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3NwZWVkaGFjay5pby9ldmVudHMvYmVybGluLXNwZWVkaGFjaw==">SpeedHack</a>, a special format hackathon, made popular at earlier APIStrat events. Fast, furious and fun, SpeedHack compresses clearly defined API challenges posed by sponsors into three hours. Special event sponsors include Twitter, Twilio, Apidaze, Context.io, Cronofy, Stamplay, and streamdata.io.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to balance the needs of people just learning about the space, stay in tune with fast moving conversations like API design, and hypermedia, while also addressing real-world conversations going on in the trenches at companies of every size&rdquo;, said Kin Lane, of API Evangelist and co-organizer of APIStrat. &ldquo;We hope to strike a balance between where we have been, and where we are going in the API space, with relevant talks for both business leaders, and developers.&rdquo;</p>
