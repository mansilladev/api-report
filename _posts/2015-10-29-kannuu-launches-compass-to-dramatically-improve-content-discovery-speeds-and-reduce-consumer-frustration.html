<p><a href="http://www.kannuu.com">Kannuu Pty Ltd</a>, a provider of search, discovery and personalized recommendation solutions for the connected television and media industry, announced today the release of COMPASS, an API plugin for MVPD and OTT providers that improves consumers content search and discovery speeds dramatically, reducing time to discover content up to 95 percent, or greater.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">COMPASS enhances and improves existing search and discovery user interfaces and overall performance by adding a simple UI overlay element to the on-screen letter grid search function. When searching for content, COMPASS returns a set of predictive suggestions to help the user quickly complete their search entry for titles, sporting events, people or keywords.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Driven by predictive train-of-thought algorithms, the new API plugin provides a "Compass" overlay that sits directly on the provider&rsquo;s existing on-screen letter grid search. Kannuu&rsquo;s patented user experience and backend technology drive the overlay, predicting the next selection a consumer will make and thus reducing the time needed to find a typical result. The accuracy, speed and predictability of this system significantly diminishes consumer time spent looking for content of interest, thus greatly increasing customer satisfaction and stimulating added spend.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Today, video-on-demand and paid content purchases account for a significant share of profit for video, cable and OTT providers globally,&rdquo; said Kannuu CEO Todd Viegut. &ldquo;However, experience shows that users become frustrated and lose interest if it&rsquo;s too difficult to find what they&rsquo;re looking for. Testing shows that consumers using the new COMPASS input method successfully completed more of their desired show searches. This leads to more engaged customers that purchase more content.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Research has shown that successful completions of content searches are key to increasing revenues. A recent study by Rovi of people using TV &amp; mobile apps showed more than 70 percent of respondents expressed frustration when searching for content. Respondents spent an average of 19 minutes a day just looking for something to watch. Thirty-three percent said they often never find something they want, and 7 percent said that when that happens, they turn off their device completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">COMPASS greatly decreases consumer frustration by making it easier and faster to input text into any content search environment. The product is now available in early release and will become fully available in late October. For more information please see Kannuu's website at http://www.kannuu.com.</p>
