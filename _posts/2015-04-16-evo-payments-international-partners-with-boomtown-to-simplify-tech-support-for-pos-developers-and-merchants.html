<p>EVO Payments International (EVO), a leading card payment acquirer and payment service provider operating in the United States, Canada and Europe, and Boomtown, a San Francisco based provider of on-demand tech support for small to medium-sized businesses (SMB), today announced a partnership that will provide push button IT support for POS developers and their SMB customers.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who integrate with the EVO Snap* platform will gain access to a full spectrum of on-demand deployment and IT support services for their customers through Boomtown&rsquo;s nationwide support network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking care of SMB customers goes beyond software and merchant services support,&rdquo; said Peter Osberg, Senior Vice President of EVO Snap*. &ldquo;It requires a holistic approach to support that includes the merchant&rsquo;s physical environment. We can provide a seamless payment experience at POS, but if a local network goes down or a physical piece of hardware fails, the merchant can&rsquo;t conduct business. Boomtown is the missing link in the support value chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By partnering with Boomtown, EVO is able to combine its suite of world-class merchant acquiring and processing solutions with on-demand support - enabling qualified ISV partners to provide scalable and highly valuable IT and business operations support to shared SMB customers. Through their next gen support technology Boomtown provides 24/7 remote troubleshooting &ndash; from hardware installations and network setup to ongoing monitoring &ndash; and onsite support services through its brigade of highly trained technicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to partner with such a forward looking organization as EVO who is redefining the SMB customer experience,&rdquo; said Chip Kahn, Founder &amp; Mayor at Boomtown. &ldquo;Boomtown&rsquo;s collaborative support software enables us to collectively solve SMB customer issues remotely and onsite. This gives business owners their time back and leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention for their POS software and merchant service provider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EVO has launched the partnership program with its own mobile POS solution, Snap* mobile &ndash; offering free remote tech support from Boomtown to qualified merchants.
