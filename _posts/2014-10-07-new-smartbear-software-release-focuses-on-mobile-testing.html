<p>Development, testing, and API readiness provider&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1oy8CIN">SmartBear Software</a> has released a new versions of its QAComplete and TestComplete software, now with a heavier focus on mobile app development.</p>
<p>The new releases are looking to break down silos between mobile development teams, and &ldquo;help organizations accelerate application delivery time and product quality by improving collaboration across software testing groups&rdquo;, by providing a "single interface for test orchestration".</p>
<blockquote><em>"Success of QA management and automation platforms is ensured when different users such as QA head, QA manager, engineers and business analysts have right insights to coordinate testing efforts across multiple platforms,&rdquo; said Ajith J. Pillai, President &amp; CEO, Nous Infosystems, a global solution partner for SmartBear. &ldquo;With this release, along with enhanced support for mobile testing, SmartBear offers an integrated platform that delivers a unified view of all testing efforts across teams. As a partner who provides SmartBear related testing services, tool implementation, solutions to migrate testing products to the SmartBear platform, and a dedicated offshore based SmartBear lab, we believe a consolidated platform providing end-to-end traceability as well as support to manage and schedule all testing efforts is a big win for our customers."</em></blockquote>
<p>Mobile development members can now collaborate on the design and planning of the tests, and schedule automated or manual tests for all of their different environments, which now also includes support for PhoneGap, iOS 8 and Chromium Embedded Framework, among many frameworks.
