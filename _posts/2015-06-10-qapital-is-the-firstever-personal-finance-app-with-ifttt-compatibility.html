<p><a href="https://www.qapital.com/">Qapital</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/qapitalapp">@qapitalapp</a>), the gamified, mobile-first banking app dedicated to changing the way millennials save for the future, is now compatible with IFTTT, a web-based service that allows users to create &ldquo;recipes" powered by &ldquo;if this, then that&rdquo; technology.</p>
<p>IFTTT, often referred to as &ldquo;digital duct tape&rdquo;, will allow Qapital customers to turn their everyday online behaviors into opportunities to save money. Qapital users create a goal (such as a trip to Italy, a rainy day fund, a month&rsquo;s security deposit) and then use IFTTT to create &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; that trigger the savings needed to meet it. IFTTT features connectivity with 184 apps, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Uber, GitHub, ESPN, and Instagram.</p>
<p>IFTTT&rsquo;s simple (but endlessly creative) &ldquo;if this, then that&rdquo; interface allows Qapital to link almost any daily activity to their savings goals. For example, they can trigger a few dollars&rsquo; worth of savings every time they use a specific hashtag, post a photo on Instagram during work hours, or remember to turn down their connected thermostat. They can &ldquo;fine&rdquo; themselves for posting on Facebook too often or &ldquo;reward&rdquo; themselves after walking a mile.  (Qapital users will also continue to have access to its in-app rules, which include &ldquo;Set It and Forget It&rdquo; &ldquo;Round-Up&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guilty Pleasure.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to introduce the Qapital Channel to the growing IFTTT community,&rdquo; said a spokesperson from IFTTT. &ldquo;With over 180 other applications Qapital users can integrate with on IFTTT, saving and celebrating financial goals couldn't be easier or more fun."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qapital is the first banking app to approach personal finance from a lifestyle perspective,&rdquo;  says CEO and co-founder George Friedman. &ldquo;IFTTT is a fantastic compliment to our present gamified savings offerings, which allow users to save money according to their own unique behaviors and habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Meet Qapital</strong><br />Qapital combines beautiful design with cutting-edge financial technology. Its founders have deep roots in international banking and financial services, including leading roles at Avanza (Sweden&rsquo;s largest online brokerage bank) and Asian banking giant Nomura. Its designers have all worked at the award-winning design firm Doberman. Qapital&rsquo;s vibrant color scheme is taken from Swedish banknotes, a nod to the company&rsquo;s roots and ethos of transparency.</p>
<p>Qapital is powered by Plaid, a San Francisco-based API that aggregates financial-account data, and by Social Money, a financial processing technology company. Qapital accounts are held by Iowa-based Lincoln Savings Bank, a 115-year-old institution and member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
