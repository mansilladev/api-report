<p>Today we are happy to release the <a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/services/lifelog-api/get-started/">Lifelog API</a>, which gives you as a developer secure access to lifestyle data of your&nbsp;users. This way, you can provide your users with insight and inspire smarter choices based on their physical activities, app usage and location. Of course, the user has full control and must approve to share data with your app.</p>
<p>With the Lifelog app from Sony, users can log their life through sensors in their smartphone and connected SmartWear devices. The Lifelog app uploads the data to the Lifelog platform data store, and with the Lifelog API, you as a developer can access this data through the endpoints&nbsp;<em>User profile</em>,&nbsp;<em>Activities</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Location</em>.</p>
