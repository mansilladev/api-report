<p><a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom Corporation</a>&nbsp;(NASDAQ: BRCM), a global innovation leader in semiconductor solutions for wired and wireless communications, today announced the availability of the&nbsp;Broadcom Open Network Switch Library&nbsp;(OpenNSL), a new software platform for Original Equipment Markers (OEMs), Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and network operators. OpenNSL is a software interface with a set of APIs that enable the development of new applications on top of Broadcom StrataXGS&reg; switches, giving customers the flexibility to tailor their network equipment and meet unique infrastructure requirements.

<p>With the OpenNSL software platform,&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;is publishing APIs that map&nbsp;Broadcom's&nbsp;Software Development Kit (SDK) to an open north bound interface, enabling the integration of new applications and the ability to optimize switch hardware platforms. This gives users the freedom to control their technology, share their designs and boost application innovation. Examples include network monitoring, load balancing, service chaining, workload optimization and traffic engineering.</p>
<p>"We have been working closely with our partners on the OpenNSL project and expect continued support and growth of the community on this initiative," said&nbsp;Ram Velaga,&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;Senior Vice President and General Manager, Network Switch. "Our software is designed to give developers direct access to&nbsp;Broadcom's&nbsp;rich feature set, enabling a higher degree of programmability and providing better control and management of the network."</p>
<p>Broadcom&nbsp;is working with leading software developers on new network applications based on the Broadcom OpenNSL APIs. In addition,&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;provides reference code for applications leveraging unique&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;switch functionality. The OpenNSL package supports a suite of network monitoring and analytics tools known as BroadView instrumentation. This BroadView instrumentation software is supported by Broadcom Tomahawk&trade; and Trident II&trade; switches and offers rich congestion monitoring with packet and flow visibility for the developer community. This enables a new class of innovation in fabric instrumentation agents and network orchestration controllers.</p>
<p><strong>Industry quotes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem Partners</strong><br /><strong>Najam Ahmad, Vice President of Network Engineering, Facebook</strong><br /><em>"The disaggregation of the network stack&nbsp;increases programmability and provides flexibility for better control and management of the network. Open access to the Broadcom SDK is a big win for the industry&mdash; it promotes an ecosystem of open technology development and provides people with more choice when building their network."</em></p>
<p><strong>Kamala Subramaniam, Principal Architect, Microsoft&nbsp;</strong><br /><em>"We welcome&nbsp;Broadcom's&nbsp;OpenNSL as an advancement for the future of the open networking ecosystem. We're excited to collaborate with the company as they join the&nbsp;Open Compute Project&nbsp;(OCP) community's Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) specifications to help innovate the next generation of networks."</em></p>
<p><strong>Suzuki Hikaru, Head of Software Innovation Center,&nbsp;NTT</strong><br /><em>"We are very excited that the OpenNSL software package enables innovation on datacenter and carrier networks with direct access to&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;chipsets. The combination of OpenNSL and our open source effort,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://osrg.github.io/ryu/" target="_blank">Ryu SDN Framework</a>, enables new application and services. We continue to work closely with the SDN open source community."</em></p>
<p><strong>Gregg Holzrichter, Chief Marketing Officer, BigSwitch</strong><br /><em>"We're really excited to support OpenNSL on our Open Network Linux (</em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opennetlinux.org/" target="_blank"><em>http://www.opennetlinux.org</em></a><em>) project. Having an open API to the underlying packet forward hardware completes the big missing piece in the open networking ecosystem."</em></p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong><br />Broadcom's&nbsp;OpenNSL includes API documentation, a developer's guide and sample code and allows operator innovation on OEM and ODM switches.</p>
