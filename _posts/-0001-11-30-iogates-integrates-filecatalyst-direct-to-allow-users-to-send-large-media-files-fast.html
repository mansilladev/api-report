<p><a href="http://www.utechsoft.com/">Unlimi-Tech Software, Inc.</a>, the Emmy&reg; Award winning creator of FileCatalyst, today announces an integration partnership with Copenhagen, Denmark based ioGates.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ioGates has developed a simple solution to handling media files that does not require advanced technical knowledge and can be securely managed from within a web browser. The company&rsquo;s flagship ioGates cloud-based video management platform is designed to handle a variety of professional video and audio formats and codecs, yet can be controlled securely from a simple-to-use web interface.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The FileCatalyst Direct API has been integrated into ioGates upload and sharing service to allow users of ioGates to easily share media files. Many users are regularly uploading files between 10-200 GB in size, and regular FTP or HTTP was simply not reliable or fast enough. FileCatalyst&rsquo;s UDP-based technology enables users to share these large media files in minutes, at accelerated speeds of up to 10 Gbps. The patented technology is immune to latency and packet loss associated with traditional file transfer methods, and guarantees files will be delivered reliably and securely.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;So far our experience integrating with FileCatalyst has been very positive&rdquo; said  Jesper Andersen at ioGates. &ldquo;ioGates gets to take advantage of a super simple UDP integration that our clients love, since they can be guaranteed that their files will be uploaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The partnership with ioGates is a great fit for FileCatalyst,&rdquo; said Alan Atkinson, Vice President of Business Development at FileCatalyst,  &ldquo;ioGates customers now have an innovative way to send their files right from within the software, which makes this integration beneficial to both companies.&rdquo;</p>
