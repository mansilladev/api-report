<p><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, the choice of more than two million software professionals for building and delivering the world&rsquo;s best applications, has formed an API technology alliance with WSO2. The company has released a new plugin that allows users to import APIs from WSO2 API Manager into Ready! API, the first fully integrated, extensible and affordable platform to help development, testing and operations teams build reliable, scalable and secure APIs. WSO2 API Manager is a complete product for designing and publishing APIs, creating and managing a developer community, and for routing API traffic.WSO2 enables businesses to build, integrate and manage their APIs, applications and Web services on-premises, in the cloud and on mobile devices.<br /><br />&ldquo;We're very happy to integrate with the WSO2 API Manager platform because it has great synergy with our Ready! API offering,&rdquo; said Lorinda Brandon, Director, API Partner Development at SmartBear. &ldquo;From their support of Swagger, OAuth and mocking, to the way they value their community, WSO2 has a strong allegiance with SmartBear. This plugin offers WSO2 customers access to like-minded tools for the entire API lifecycle, from design through testing and deployment.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ready! API&rsquo;s plugin architecture makes extending the tool fast and easy. The plugin framework uses annotation-based extension points instead of XML configuration files and provides automatic installation of any third-party dependencies. Ready! API offers a plugin browser so Ready! API users are able to find and install plugins quickly and easily.<br /><br />&ldquo;The combination of SmartBear&rsquo;s Ready! API and WSO2 API Manager provides a powerful solution for publishing, testing and managing APIs,&rdquo; said Isabelle Mauny, WSO2 Vice President of Product Management. &ldquo;We are proud to team with SmartBear and offer a plugin that allows users to leverage the full capabilities of Ready! API to test APIs published in WSO2 API Manager. Through the plugin, users can import an API into Ready! API simply by providing the WSO2 API Manager connection details and selecting the API to test, providing a seamless experience.&rdquo;<br /><br />Earlier this month, SmartBear announced the SmartBear Developer Network (SDN) for its community of users and partners to freely build integrations and plugins to further extend the functionality of the company&rsquo;s software quality tools.
