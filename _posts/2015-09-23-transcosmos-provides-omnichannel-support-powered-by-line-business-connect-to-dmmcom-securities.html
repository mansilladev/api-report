<p><a href="http://transcosmos.com/">Transcosmos Inc.</a> has started providing &ldquo;Omni-channel Support Powered by LINE Business Connect&rdquo; to DMM.com Securities Co., Ltd. (hereafter, DMM.com Securities).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Omni-channel Support Powered by LINE Business Connect&rdquo; is a service which makes it possible for users to become friends with company accounts that turn into contact points and to achieve two-way communications via the LINE talk function. As a part of their enhancements to support systems for mobile terminals, DMM.com securities has been considering the service of &ldquo;LINE&rdquo; to their inquiry contacts. Since they have been evaluating transcosmos&rsquo;s proposal capabilities and track record, they decided to implement the service through transcosmos.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The following comments have been received from the head of DMM.com Securities&rsquo; corporate planning:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our company has been contemplating the introduction of LINE, as a communication tool for our services DMMFX and Gaitame Japan FX to establishing communication with users different from telephone and e-mail. Through considering the track record of this service, including the Oracle Service Cloud (*) UI, as well as reliability and future development, we decided to place our request with transcosmos. Three months have passed since the start-up on May 18, but there have been many inquiries concerning minor questions related to trading rules and FX. I think that the ability to easily ask questions and consult has been accepted particularly among the younger age groups. In the future, we will look forward to seeing proposals for communication and support using a variety of different channels.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">transcosmos has been certified as a partner company in the &ldquo;LINE Business Connect Partner Program,&rdquo; which makes it possible to propose the ideal application methods for LINE Business Connect.
