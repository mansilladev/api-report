<p><a href="http://www.autosoftdms.com">Autosoft, Inc.</a>, a leading national dealer management systems (DMS) provider, announced the release of APIs for third party service software providers to facilitate integrations with its FLEX dealer management system. The release of these APIs will enable service software providers to develop real-time bi-directional integrations with Autosoft&rsquo;s FLEX DMS and further expand their third partner integration program, FLEX Connect. The FLEX Connect program currently has over 75 participants, and as a result of this release, the company expects to welcome a dozen more partners to the program.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The FLEX Connect program gives dealers complete control over the software providers they select to manage various aspects of their business and facilitates integrations between systems to enhance dealership operations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Recently, CDK Global announced plans to significantly raise costs for dealers to integrate with third party providers,&rdquo; said Christopher Morris, Senior Vice President of Business Development for Autosoft. &ldquo;At Autosoft, we believe in giving dealers the best DMS possible and making it easy and affordable to choose software solutions that fit their business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Autosoft works with Motive Retail LLC to enable third party vendors to build Autosoft integration points. By allowing third parties to build the APIs in a safe and secure environment, the process is cost-effective and more efficient. The result is more robust integration points for the dealer. Motive Integrator is a best-in-class SaaS solution developed by Motive Retail LLC, and is an industry-specific collaboration platform designed to support the development and testing of integrations between OEMs or dealer software providers and automotive dealerships.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Motive Integrator provides development and testing tools that help data service providers (DSPs) quickly and securely integrate, test, and certify all types of software interfaces.  By allowing DSPs to build their own integrations, the resulting integrations between the DSPs and FLEX DMS are much stronger, as DSPs and their developers know their products best.</p>
