<p><a href="https://www.unicon.net/">Unicon, Inc.</a>, a leading IT consulting, services, and support provider specializing in open source for the education technology market, today announced that it, along with services from Marist College, has been selected by Jisc to develop learning analytics components for Jisc&rsquo;s open source learning analytics and student intervention IT infrastructure. Jisc is a registered charity that champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research. Jisc will be implementing Learning Analytics Processor, developed by Marist College; OpenDashboard; and Student Success Plan (SSP). Learning Analytics Processor and OpenDashboard are Apereo Foundation incubation projects, and SSP is a fully sponsored Apereo project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apereo is excited to be a part of Jisc&rsquo;s student success initiatives,&rdquo; said Ian Dolphin, Executive Director, Apereo Foundation. &rdquo;Learning Analytics Processor, OpenDashboard, and SSP will help Jisc provide quality educational tools, while enhancing student success and learning with leading-edge technologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jisc plans on developing a flexible, basic learning analytics service that would include the three student success projects, in addition to custom development. The Java-based Learning Analytics Processor is used to provide predictions on student success to feed into student intervention systems that provides a low-cost, open source method to implement learning analytics at institutions. OpenDashboard is a web application that provides a framework for displaying analytics visualizations and data views called &ldquo;cards.&rdquo; Cards represent a single discrete visualization or data view but share an API and data model.  OpenDashboard was funded by the Uniformed Services University (USU). SSP is case management software that supports a holistic coaching and counseling model, which can be used for student intervention.</p>
<p>Unicon will also be providing assessment services for the Discovery stage of the Jisc project, which involves an in-depth readiness assessment for institutions to help them assess their readiness to participate in the learning analytics project.</p>
