<p>Eagle Software, the leading provider of Student Information Systems for California K-12 schools, today announced a new partnership with LearnSprout, a fast-growing predictive analytics company for K-12 schools and districts. The partnership will provide California schools using Aeries.net with early warning software that will identify at-risk students, track chronic absenteeism and identify historical trends in student data. The integration will also allow for the use of the new LearnSprout Dashboard, which allows high school counselors to monitor college readiness for an entire school at a glance.</p>
<p>Key to the partnership is the use of the new Aeries API for integration, which provides secure, real-time data synchronization between the two systems. &ldquo;By using the Aeries API to sync data, schools can rest assured that their data is protected using the most secure method of data transport possible,&rdquo; said Barry Lloyd, President of Eagle Software. &ldquo;With the API, Aeries is able to provide LearnSprout with real-time updates to its early warning solution, offering educators with timely insights into student performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the great advantages of Aeries is its capacity to securely store enormous amounts of student information,&rdquo; said Frank Chien, CEO of LearnSprout. &ldquo;This data holds all of the leading indicators for at-risk student identification. With timely updates coming directly from Aeries, we&rsquo;ll be able to alert educators to students who are most in need of intervention.&rdquo;</p>
