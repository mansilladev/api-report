<p><a href="http://www.FullSailPartners.com">Full Sail Partners</a> is set to unveil new custom solutions and integrated offerings for Deltek Vision&reg; ERP at Deltek Insight 2015. The Vision Connector Suite includes ready-to-go solutions focused on keeping professional services firms centered on efficient production by connecting their critical business systems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Full Sail Partners Vision Connector Suite allows quick connections from Deltek Vision to other API capable applications. This next generation framework allows both Deltek Vision cloud and on-premise systems to seamlessly integrate with best-in-class cloud applications like Constant Contact, MailChimp, SharePoint for Office 365, Client Feedback Tool, and more. This cutting edge technology allows firms to integrate critical business systems at a fraction of the development time and cost needed to build out similar solutions, with none of the traditional network topology restrictions. Solutions include:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Automated Feedback Process </strong><br />Full Sail Partners is releasing version 2.0 for the Client Feedback Tool, a cloud solution built to help firms collect and incorporate feedback from their clients throughout the project life cycle. Leveraging the Vision Connector between these two systems was ideal for a prebuilt integration. A team of experts developed an automated process to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency while adhering to the feedback philosophy set forth by the Client Feedback Tool. Full Sail Partners integration with the Client Feedback Tool allows Deltek Vision clients to deploy surveys on-demand or through a batch process, as well as, view the survey response status directly in Vision.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Email Marketing Connectors</strong> <br />Deltek Vision now integrates with <a title="Constant Contact" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS8xUE82czhL">Constant Contact</a> enabling firms to populate data directly to their email marketing tool from Deltek Vision CRM in a matter of minutes. The Connector maintains consistency between the two applications and eliminates manual importing and exporting of data. This mutual relationship between data will save marketing teams hundreds of hours each year. The solution provides tracking capabilities through the Deltek Vision Marketing Campaigns Info Center providing visibility that can be leveraged throughout the system.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Deltek Vision Meets SharePoint Office 365 </strong><br />The SharePoint Connector is a quick and easy way to bring data in Deltek Vision and SharePoint into harmony.  Beyond basic connectivity, the SharePoint Connector also integrates with Gig Werks&rsquo; ProjectReady Suite of Applications&rsquo; best in class SharePoint solutions built for the AEC industry. This bi-direction data synchronization ensures data accuracy and consistency across all of your projects.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We look forward to expanding our investment in business productivity and integration offerings,&rdquo; said Peter Nuffer, Director of Solution Development at Full Sail Partners. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve effectively established a layer of functionality on top of the Vision API that will allow Deltek Vision administrators to setup easy point and click ready-to-go solutions with low costs and high tech results.&rdquo;</p>
