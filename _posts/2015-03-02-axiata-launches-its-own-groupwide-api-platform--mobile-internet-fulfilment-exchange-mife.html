<p><a href="http://www.axiata.com/">Axiata Group Berhad&nbsp;<strong>(Axiata)</strong></a>, one of Asia&rsquo;s largest telecommunications companies, through its digital services unit, Axiata Digital Services (<strong>ADS</strong>), announced the launch of MIFE, its own Application Programme Interface (<strong>API</strong>) platform for all of its Operating Companies (OpCos) across Asia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;ADS&rsquo; mission is to both contribute to the bottom line of our operating companies as well as create longer term value through partnership and acquisitions in the digital ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Internally built by Dialog Axiata Group&rsquo;s development team and powered by WSO2&rsquo;s class leading open source middleware technology, the MIFE service is designed to help Axiata&rsquo;s OpCos fully leverage emerging digital opportunities as part of its overall digital strategy. The service will allow for faster engagement and partnerships, opening up a new way of doing business in the digital space.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer of ADS Mohd Khairil Abdullah says,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;ADS&rsquo; mission is to both contribute to the bottom line of our operating companies as well as create longer term value through partnership and acquisitions in the digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MIFE effectively addresses both these scenarios. Our OpCos already have outstanding digital services teams who are innovating at a furious pace, our hope is MIFE will enable further value generation and deeper synergies within the Axiata Group. One of the main advantages of the technology choice is that we can further develop it ourselves; this will allow faster and more cost-effective integration of new opportunities we haven&rsquo;t even thought of yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MIFE is positioned as both an external and internal smart enablement platform and is set up as a service for Axiata OpCos. With core network services exposed via simple-to-use web-centric APIs, OpCos can also leverage the MIFE APIs for internal products, local partnerships and collaboration with other mobile network operators (MNOs) in these countries. One early example is Mobile Connect &ndash; local MIFE gateways enable immediate participation with local MNOs in this important project.</p>
<p>With the radical new open source digital enablement platform available at each of its OpCos, Axiata is further able to offer internet service providers (ISPs) other mobile network operators (MNOs) the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Direct Operator Billing, SMS, LBS and Identity Services</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">A streamlined engagement model with a single contract offering access to other APIs</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Centralized support for fast track SP integration</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Centralized reconciliation services and reporting</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Optional SDKs for specific partner opportunities</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">GSMA One API compatible APIs</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">GSMA Mobile Connect compliant identity services.</li>
</ul>
<p>MIFE was built to address some of the key challenges that most MNOs face in the digital age and has been informed by the global telecommunications industry as well as best practices in the Internet world. Internet companies are very agile in building collaborations and adopting ideas from communities, enabling them to quickly develop and launch new products and services to MNO customers. MIFE enables Axiata OpCos to do the same, enabling quick and easy strategic partnership, reducing internal choke points and permitting rapid innovation.</p>
<p>Group Chief Technology Officer of Axiata Amandeep Singh said, &ldquo;The MIFE platform has been implemented at fraction of the annual group Capex budget and is a great example of a creative CIO at work. We have deployed several open source technologies across the group but this is the first time such a complete service layer has been implemented for mission critical Axiata services. MIFE is also being used in Dialog Axiata PLC for core internal services, which is a testament to the robustness and scalability of the WSO2 code base. In addition the developer-friendly adaptor and API layers will allow us to cost effectively innovate and refine the platform with web or Java developers which are widely available skill sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currently Dialog<span>1</span>, XL<span>2</span>&nbsp;and Robi<span>3</span>, are fully integrated with Celcom<span>4</span>&nbsp;and Smart<span>5</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to follow by the end of the first quarter.</p>
