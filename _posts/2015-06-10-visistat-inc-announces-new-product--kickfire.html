<p>VisiStat, Inc., a cloud-based B2B sales automation company, today announced the launch of its latest product - <a href="https://www.kickfire.com">KickFire</a>. KickFire is a sales prospecting tool that lives in the browser, delivers actionable information about a company, and pushes key organizational contacts directly to your CRM, all without having to leave the website.</p>
<p>A recent survey by leading information technology research firm, Gartner, Inc. concluded that 67% of a salesperson&rsquo;s time is dedicated to non-selling activities such as research, data entry, and other busy work. With KickFire&trade;, sales development teams can accelerate the lead generation process by reducing sales prospecting time and getting more highly qualified leads into the sales pipeline faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;KickFire&trade; was born as an internal tool for our own sales team. We found that over half of a sales person&rsquo;s day was spent prospecting, researching and data entry -- we needed a single tool that would allow them to spend more time connecting with prospects and selling, instead of administrative activities,&rdquo; said VisiStat CEO, Stephen Oachs.</p>
<p>"With KickFire&trade; we were able to greatly increase our sales productivity efforts by combining the necessary tools into an easy to use browser extension. As a result, our sales people could prospect leads, conduct research and find contacts within seconds. Knowing this is a universal sales challenge, we decided to launch KickFire&trade; to the public to help other sales teams maximize their performance."</p>
<p>KickFire&trade; provides:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Verified company firmographics including revenue, industry, and social profiles.</li>
<li> Direct contact email and telephone number of key decision-makers by location and department.</li>
<li> Instant integration with leading sales tools such as SalesForce&reg; and LinkedIn&reg;.</li>
<li> Real-time analysis of website services and technologies currently used by the prospect.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the information that powers KickFire&trade; is also available via a RESTful API to create and enhance applications such as content personalization, fraud detection, B2B ad-targeting, and more.</p>
